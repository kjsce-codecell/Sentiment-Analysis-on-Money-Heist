4	Should have ended in Season 2	"Well, the writers and producers outdone themselves. They started with a good idea, intriguing characters and an elaborate plot. By the end of season 2 it became apparent they could not drag this anymore. Season 3 was just a ""remake"" of season 1 but, my God, season 4 is an awful soap opera...seems almost like a ""filler"" season...no actual plot, no actual action...you could skip straight to episode 7 if u want and still..you wouldnt miss a thing. Hire better writers, because this cast is impeccable."	0
1	The more seasons it got, the worse it became	First and second parts were great. 3rd was ok, 4th worse. 5th won a 1 star from me. The forth and backs of the characters made it a very bad series.	0
3	Bid good bye to common sense..	The more u watch it.. the dumber it gets.. idea of the plot is good. Direction is just like a soap opera.	0
3	I don't get the hype	With a 100% positive critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes and with many of my friends going crazy for it, my opition might not be very popular. But I find La Casa de Papel (Money Heist) to be utterly ridiculous, overly melodramatic and just plain stupid.	0
4	and we thought stormtroopers were bad	No matter how hard they try with the story, it's impossible to sit there and not burst out laughing or cringe at every scene with guns. They should just take as much of the shooting aspect out of this show as possible because nothing's funnier than seeing 10 people shoot with unlimited magazines/bullets and missing every single shot. I just can't take this show seriously.	0
1	ROBBED MY TIME AND INTELLECT	Professor what are we robbing in season 3-4-5? Professor: People Will think we are robbing the bank of Spain, However wee are actually going to rob the viewers of their time, we will insult their intellect with every scene and episode, make them cringe and want to kill themselves with unnecessary gay drama, show them some of the most unrealistic action the world has seen. And that way we will rob them of their time. THE BIGGEST HEIST IN MANKID!!!!!	0
3	Unnecessary seasons	This series should have ended in season 2, season 3 and 4 totally unnecessary	0
4	dont be fooled by the ratings	This is a soap opera, looks like a smart tv show but it's a latin soap opera and you watch it like that(50% brain turned off, the logic part)	0
1	# Free Palestine	Another season another crap ,Zionists and Criminal support, shame on you and wate of time .	0
2	What a waste of time!!	I really dont get it, what do these high ratings see in this series. This is the most dumbest heist i have ever seen. You plan something for years, you train people for months and then what? During the heist they fight among themselves? Forced soap opera level drama in a heist story. Dumbest series ever!	0
1	Heist -- it's over rated----- don't watch & waste time	Writers are stretching story. In chaos, they acting more chaotic with their personal relationship & what entry Arturo Roman planned in season 4. Why to use copy who is having medical conditions. I felt bad for Spain people how they see this & is it military or police so dumb in Spain.....it's very boring by giving name money heist....you guys were showing daily soap relationship fights half of the time. & Freaking phyco people were plan to rob.........	0
2	Painfully Bad	I have never been more confused by a high rating for a show. Not a single part of it is well executed. The acting is not good, the writing is much much worse. None of the characters behave remotely like real people.... it's a mess. It's basically looney toons robbing a bank, but somehow very sad and excruciatingly boring.	0
1	Shame!!	Shame on you to support the occupiers, Spanish people are known with their support to freedom of people!!	0
1	Hypocritical message	Claim to support the oppressed and downtrodden yet they openly support the Zionist occupation of the Palestinians.	0
3	One of the dumbest show I have ever seen in my life.	"Is Spanish police/administration this dumb as shown in the series then 'god help them'. From the logic behind the robbery that ""we are not stealing from people but just printing our own money"" is also one of the dumbest logic applied in the history of heist movies/series. Have they even heard of a word ""inflation""?. I wasted my 10- 15 hrs watching season 1 and 2. If you are a guy/girl who watches lot of quality movies/series then please don't waste you time on this."	0
1	The most illogical & exaggerated show of all times!	Money Heist is a stupidly organized heist in which amateur thiefs deal with dumb police with so much of melodrama blended with nonsense events! It's nothing but a bigger version of daily soap TV serials! I don't get it why it is that much high rated but this is a pure waste of your intellectual & time!	0
1	Makes no sense.	Yea what a waste of time. The professor has time to go on dates during a robbery? Sad series.	0
3	Overrated	These guys call themselves revolutionaries, but all they did is to rob banks and live a luxurious life with the money they stole from state, Real REVOLUTIONARIES are people who put their life at risk for the opposed and poor, these guys are not revolutionaries, they are just murderers and bank robbers. And this show is just over glorification of crime and bank robbers	0
10	One of the best I've seen!	This has been a real treat! An amazing series, great acting, direction and such a suspenseful story it's really one of the very best I've seen ever. I love heist movies and I just found this one in Netflix and I literally couldn't stop watching through the night. The characters are simply amazing! Don't miss this!	1
9	Awesome	I found this Spanish TV series by chance, I really recommend you watch it. It's one of the best series that I have seen lately. A chess game between the police and the robbers, you will be surprised by its development. You can not foresee anything. (I hope that my review is correct, I'm not a native speaker)	1
1	Shame	Shame of you supporting Israel, that occupied Palestine area and migrate people keep killing kids and occupied women.	0
10	One of the best series I've seen in a while	Fast paced. Action. Great acting. Ingenious plot. This show is perfect. 10/10 for me	1
1	The IMDb rating does not correspond reality	It sounded promising but after just a few episodes it lost it. Everything about this is very bad. Don't wast your time. I'm hate watching it just because my ocd won't let me stop.	0
4	Overrated	"Most overrated show i ever see!!

stupid acting, nonsense events"	0
10	Truly excellent	Congratulations to the actors, director, writer and anyone who made this season of episodes possible. Every episode had it's gripping and human slow moments, such a wonderful balance. Couldn't wait to see the next episode. Each one had surprises, no standard script, which is so enjoyable. The actors played so well, better than many of the better known Hollywood names. Hope the next season is coming up soon.	1
3	This should have ended on season 2	The story is tiringly repetitive Creativity was lost in the last 2 seasons because the story was complete but then netflix decided to order more Just let it be over It became junk-food television	0
9	Loved the first two seasons	Loved the series, actors were perfect fit for each role and they make you root for them. It both has drama from the heist and romantic part to it. In my opinion season 3 and 4 didn't meet the expectations after the first two. It feels kinda forced because everybody was so obsessed when it came out on Netflix that it kills all the good from the first two seasons. If you can watch the first two season and you will end up loving it to the top.	1
3	Overrated Nonsense	I watched about 4 episode of this before giving up. The premise was good but it all quickly descended into farce.	0
9	Extremely Good	Could not stop watching this series. What an excellent set of actors fully into their roles in a natural way. Refreshing storyline unlike most other movies or series about bank robberies. Can't wait for season two	1
2	Poo	Over-acting from every single idiotic character who all do idiotic things for reasons unfathomable to any normal functioning human on the face of the earth. I couldn't handle more than 3 episodes of the first season. That is a chunk of my life I'll never get back! Save yourself and avoid.	0
8	Pretty Entertaining!	I've heard about how good Money Heist is since it started back in 2017 but for some reason I put off watching it. I finally gave in and started watching it recently and now I can't stop, it's every bit as good as everyone says it is. The writing and acting are both excellent, there are so many twists and surprises that it will keep you on the edge of your seat and guessing throughout the entire series! Just a little warning...once you start watching it it's hard to stop, you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible!	1
1	Overrated	Maybe for viewers that just started watching films and TV Shows.	0
1	Worst worst worst	This show is so much overrated and european people are making so much hype of this show	0
1	This whole Series feels so off	I don't know whats going on. I feel scammed by these ratings. It almost feels like somebody pushes the hype around the series just to get some good votes. To me this series was a complete waste of time. Too many plotholes, too poor of an excecution. Generell idea is good, but thats it.	0
1	ZERO OUT OF TEN	Unintelligent Illogical Boring Cringefest clownfiesta of a series.	0
3	Starts great....stop watching after Season 1...you will thank me	"Season 1 was top notch Season 2 kept the intense drama going but started dropping close to end Season 3 We are trailing off, plot devices no longer making sense Season 4 It became obvious that the writers was just writing the craziest stuff possible and throwing it on screen.

Season 5 I stopped after episode 2 because it was all levels of stupidity. I did not care about ANY character and actors became 'cartoonish' where many people are playing over-the-top caricatures. Just sad....really really sad..."	0
8	Good Time Pass.	Yes most of the time the plot doesn't make sense because of over the top analysis of the protagonist. But still it is good Time killer. An overall nice breather and good concept for a show.	1
1	Dumb show	Female inspectors is dumb . Robber keep coming front of her she don't use her brain. . Don't waste your time with this series I'm in season 1 episode 3 I'm already bored.	0
2	Overhyped	Seriously whats the fuss about??? The main characters start showing major flaws as soon as episode 3. Plot holes which make no sense. Silly actually!	0
1	worst and illogical	This show is so much illogical and people are following it blindly from begining to the end i have never seen logic in this series	0
2	Utter Nonsense.	It's rubbish. Period. The problem is that the show takes itself very seriously but ends up becoming a caricature of itself. I have no reservations towards mindless entertainment but the sheer audacity of the writers to pull anything off from their hat under the pretext of a mastermind professor for me, is ridiculous.	0
3	Horrible and even more ridiculous Inside Man	"The show starts with done to death bank heist and makes most ridiculous heist ever.

Inside Man, although full of plot holes, was decent enough movie. This makes Inside Man Oscar material.

There are bunch horrendous turn of events no sane person will believe and then the story which is beyond ridiculous and makes you question hoe come one believe this at all.

This is perfect example how a no logic full garbage show can be made."	0
1	Speachless, this series doesn't deserve the propaganda	The series started with a good story and should have been ended since season 2 thats it, season 4 is the worse, a season with no meaning and no story and just a waste of time.	0
1	Season 4 is a total waste of time	I am very dissapointed of season 4. Nothing happened though all of the Episode except that Raquel Was release in a very unrealsitic way. They found an Helikopter Just like that and got away with it. And the pilot of the helikopet knows 50 foreign languages and how to drive an Helikopter. :D Another rediculous fact is that the pregnant detective is such a Genius that she could find Just in 5 five the Professor. Sorry, I prefer to watch Spiderman. It's more realistic and interesting.	0
1	Free Palestine	A waste of time, the events are predicted and the acting is bad.	0
10	Mindblowing	This must be one of the best series I've seen lately. It is so thrilling and unpredictable in every single episode, that you have no idea how it will end.	1
1	Very bad series	It's keep repeating the old series Nothing new Also the actors support israhell.	0
1	We don't accept your stance regarding Israel	The actors of the series, we did not like their position with Palestine. They support the Israeli occupation, and we Arabs did not like this position and were upset.	0
1	Free palestine	All those standards and principles your series where describing and fighting for do not describe you at all Keep supporting children killers , war criminals , ethic cleansing, zionism , fascism, racism and anything against human rights.	0
1	For Philistines🇵🇸	For Philistines🇵🇸 For Philistines🇵🇸For Philistines🇵🇸	0
1	Brainless direction	Too much hyped not worth it, last season is a complete waste.	0
1	Downhill after season 2	They tried to Milk this show for all it was worth. Yes season 1 & 2 were ok, but that should have been it. Watched season 5 episode 1 out of curiosity and I had no idea what was happening, just went head first with no recapping, a big mistake.	0
1	Unjustifiable immorality !	In real life, the cast of La Casa De Papel have shared their support to crimes against humanity commited by the colonial regime of Israel in Palestine. Israel continues to murder children, demolish houses, torture and imprison millions of native people while breaking more international laws and UN resolutions than any other state in the world.	0
1	Shame on you for supporting Ethnic Cleansing	Your series main idea was to support liberation of people and eventually you support Ethnic Cleansing against innocent Palestinians.	0
4	Had potential, but no	I'm not sure why this show is highly rated. Really disappointing. Had a good concept for a storyline but the it felt like it was directed in the 80s. Superficial dialogue and character relationships. Every opportunity to exploit the female characters is taken. Lots if man-handling and over sexualisation. It's all a bit cheap.	0
1	Enjoyable if you don't care for plot, script or acting	I watched the first season to please my daughter and have never in all my years seen a more ridiculous piece of contrived nonsense masquerading as entertainment. Maybe it's just me because a lot of people seem to be enjoying it so good luck to them!	0
3	From being one of my favorites, to a big disappointment	It all started great, solid performance overall. Really good way to interpert the system and how a clever team led by a genius can hurt all that corruption. But after season 2, things got way too repetitive and exagerated. It became dumb. Alpha male ladies who make compulsive decisions. The same characters doing exactly the same mistakes. You can predict pretty much every move they'll do after season 2. It could have been an amazing tv show, but it ended up as on of the worst ones in my list. HUGE CLICHE.	0
1	Pure rubbish	Plot holes and cliches everywhere, useless and superficial love scenes, stupidest police in TV history and really bad acting. Don't waste your time watching it.	0
1	We waited 5 month for this shiiiiit ohh wawoo	I can't believe how can they screw it up SOOOOO BAAAAAD it was soo good !!!!	0
1	Stupidity	It shows how stupid the police are, and tokyo is the most annoying character. It was good at first 2-3 episodes but then it gets worst.	0
3	Totally stupid plot	Total stupidity. Does this series shows that Spanish police are brainless and no capable ones are there!! Or is o only professor is the only intelligent person. Too much drama and facts are hard to digest!!	0
4	Disapoonted with season 4	Season 4 total disappointment. The whole seasom can be compleed in 2 episodes and but extended like a rubber band. Boring. Not watching season 5.	0
2	Really bad ...	The whole plot is not conclusive in itself. Seriously painful to watch for people who need atleast a little logical connections.	0
8	Wonderful TV Show	Casa de Papel is a very good TV show overall. I really enjoyed it. The plan of el profesor, the narration by Tokyo, the relationship between characters. The two first seasons was very great. The third season, at the beginning, i felt that become more a fan base but when you watched it all the season it still have some great moments: mysteries, suspense, dramatic, funny, psychological moments. I recommend this Tv show. It was a very good experience overall. The season 4 have still some great moments and the end want to see the season 5 for sure.	1
1	Bored to Tears	Can't believe everybody is watching this soap opera with guns. It seems the stupid little stories will be going forever. All I can see is some underlining neo Marxism making it appealing to the left wing uprising all over Europe.	0
1	So much love in a heist, complete rubbish	"This is so bad. A good idea, started with a lot of promise.

Why so much love and sex.

Too much style over content. I am at the last episode series one and I might not bother seeing the end.

Oh so much threat and no one ever gets killed. Is that a spoiler"	0
1	Unrealistic	Waste of time.. How can 6 people not hit a person that is 2 meters away. Gandia dodged the bullets like he is in the matrix... Harry Potter is more realistic show than this nonsense. Ty. And i regred wasting this much time...	0
1	It's meant to be for kids!	I don't know if the director has watched his series ! The idea only is great but the acting and the scenes are quite silly.	0
4	A huge mistake in the plot.	There is a huge mistake in the plot. Why didn't the robbers negotiate a deal with Gandia to surrender himself and let Tokyo go in exchange for the life of the Governor? They had the Governor in their possession all this while and didn't make use of him. That's plain stupidity. What about the genius mind of the professor and the criminal minds of the robbers? This hole in the plot is unpardonable and it made a mockery of the whole season.	0
4	Watched all 4 seasons and it's as disappointing as The Walking Dead	In the beginning it's so refreshing but from episode to episode it's just the same. Professor knows everything, no matter what's going to happen. Main characters rarely die and if they do it's a heroic death. Always the same methods to make police officers do what they want. Relationships between the characters are rarely catching and to me it's just bad acting since season 3. The motive for the second heist is just a joke. They should have ended it after two seasons. Now it's pure greed, nothing more.	0
1	Painfully Stupid	It's so hard to imagine anyone actually writing this show. It was hard to watch at all.	0
1	Dumb!	Overrated apart from some scenes with professor do you really think thieves are that dumb?	0
2	Terrible	Terrible acting. Unrealistic and underdeveloped characters. Even more unrealistic conversations between characters. The Plot, although had a great potential, was immature with illogical links and ridiculous outcomes. And out of all the characters one could criticize in this tv series lets discuss Tokyo, oh my goodness, a neurotic, mentally unstable, unrealistic character and even worse execution by the actress. Repulsive!	0
1	Last 2 seasons	Season 1 and 2 rate - 8, Season 3 and 4 rate 1. Especially season 4.nothing really happened. 80% of time they talk about past and 20% is actually action and story goes on in that time. Too bas for the series. It was promising	0
1	Complete Garbage	I have never watched a more garbage TV show in my entire life. The storyline is complete crap, it's overly dramatic and very highly overrated. I felt my blood pressure rise during each episode. Another season of this and I'll have a heart attack. I now use this show as a benchmark to better understand whether the person I'm speaking to is a complete idiot when it comes to TV shows / movies.	0
1	Went from great to awful in less than a year.	This show went from an highly well written heist, to an extremely awkward soap opera. The show did horrible in Spain until it hit Netflix. After becoming extremely popular, they hurry up and write a second heist. They are dragging one heist out with three seasons. I can't believe it went from sew good to so bad. What a disappointment	0
10	theft of heft	"One of the many great series on Netflix depicts a group of people breaking into Spain's national mint. ""La casa de papel"" (""Money Heist"" in English) is a series that you just gotta see. Rapid-fire dialogue, clever editing, and all sorts of twists and turns make this one of the best shows out there."	1
3	Disappointing	Seriously...this program have a score of 8,4 ?? Really ?? ....Money heist its a show for kids of 14 years old , with a stupid script ,with forced situations, with even more forced reactions and overacted characters ..... a dissapointing frankenstein made for teenangers and people with bad taste in shows.	0
2	First episode was good.	It started off good, but then everything gets soooooo STUPID. I should go into fortune telling with all the stuff I called out from the get go. NOT GOOD. DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE. Anyone who says otherwise is an IDIOT.	0
3	Netflix, are you ok?	Characters are changing faster then the light moving thorught the universe, unable to track the logic of them and all because of LOVE. That's not a heist movie, it is a romantic comedy of stupidity. I really like the heist part (1/10 of the movie) and it is incredible, but the truth is that Netflix is trying to highlight one part and forgets about the other, too much plot holes, too much drama, too much values that are not in the right place at the right moment of time.	0
1	Just sex and Full of extra marrital affairs	Just sex and Full of extra marrital affairs. Honestly i wasted my time watching the first season itself.	0
3	Don't understand the high reviews	This show is highly overrated. It does not deserve the high ratings. At first the concept seems interesting which is why I gave it a chance. But the story is unrealistic. You forget that the heist has only been taking place for 5 days with how quickly everyone falls in love and how quick gun shot wounds seem to heal.	0
3	Annoying soup opera drama!	"The first episodes are quite interesting, but then it's only background drama and a series of silly mistakes happening.

The plot turns out to be ridiculous and brainless... they plan a robbery for 6 months and they can't resist flirting for 48h.... And falling in love with each other. After 10 episodes you just with they kill everyone."	0
1	Worst plot ever	Plot is so stupid and unlikely, wasted a couple of hours I will never get back......	0
1	They are destroying everything	In first two seasons they built an amazing thought about the series and got a large audience, people loved the cartil, but when they decided to do 3 or maybe 4 extra seasons they are destroying all that and wasting all the efforts that has been done in first seasons They are losing the respect that they got at the beginning	0
1	terrorist	A Zionist terrorist series supporting the Zionist occupation. Damn this series... Long live a free Arab Palestine.	0
1	Supporting Israel is a crime	Whoever revolts against injustice will revolt against it everywhere. Supporting Israel is a crime.	0
1	Stop supporting Israeli occupation	The producers and actors supports Israel occupation. They should google for 2 minutes the killing and racism Israel is doing against the original citizens Palestinians.	0

9	Amazing Show- watch it in Spanish.	Only just binged the first 2 seasons and loved this show. Berlin and The Professor are amazing. Ignore the bad reviews, people complaining must be the police or Arturo. Ignore the dubbed versions of the show - watch it in Spanish with subtitles. You wont regret watching this, only problem is you will binge watch it in a week like me.	1
1	overrated	Every character in this series is illogical and overrated	0
3	It gets worse and worse...	They try to make the story so great that its just absurd now. I had to stop at season 4 ep 5 to write this.. That gun fight scene... WOW. Its like a seven year old wrote the scene. Was he on a bullet bending drug to escape that??? People give this too much credit probably for the intensity a heist creates, eventhough the movie has pointless twists all over.	0
1	Worst TV series ever	A waste of time. Not worth watching at all. The story is boring.	0
1	The worst series I ever seen	If I'd like to watch Escrava Isaura - I would. Sorry, but the plot is so sh***y, I really don't get the hype around this series. What irritates me the most: the creators try to show in a serious maner a story for elementary school children. Never again	0
4	Disappointment	I used to love this series, but now i'm annoyed. Season 1 was great and kinda logical, season 2 was OK then it went really bad and illogical. Spent 8 hours watching season 4 and ended with BIG DISAPPOINTMENT and was total waste of time just to see how it's gonna end. Not gonna watch season 5 and will certainly delete the whole series from my top list.👎🏻	0
3	Started well, got ridiculous as the series progressed!	"Loved watching first few episodes, and then! Such a unreal storyline.
People fall madly in love in 5 days.. willing to go to any lengths for love, including a police officer.
Civilians can fire guns like pros ( Monica)
The police can never hit a target but the robbers are pros
The list goes on and on. Gripping but completely ridiculous, unbelievable story line . Leave your logic in a corner, then you will enjoy it"	0
10	10/10	For Berlin..The amount of nostalgia his scenes gave to me..I didn't care avout the heist...his performance astonished me even his death was astonishing...well played	1
1	SPANISH SOAP	This is comedy, romantic and trash. Only season one is good!	0
1	Season 4 is stretched, stupid and nonesence.	Season 1 and 2 are good. Season 4 is really really very stupid. And waste of time.	0
1	Waste of time , with too much cliche and plot holes	How the hell did this series get a rating of more than 8? Illogical story with so many plot holes and stupid characters to go along with. None of the characters are likable. One of the dumbest series ever. Stopped watching after 6 episodes as my head was exploding with all the nonsense being told.	0
1	Please stop...	This series should be ended in seasson 2.. please stop	0
4	Why?	Why the high rates! This serie gets dummer and dummer.... Not worth my time..!	0
2	Not good acting	"I never will understand why in every singel scene they give like all of their ""characteristics"", it's just too much."	0
1	PALESTINE for EVER	The crew are zionists!!!!! Fu/ck your cheap show. Free Palestine! 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸	0
10	The best series in the world	"Money heist, isn't a series ; It's an emotion. It is the first spanish web series that i have seen. Omg, what a wonderful series.

All character have been acted wonderfully.

Specially Professor, Barlin, Nairobi, Ric.

Love this Series ; this is the series that can watch again and again. I never feel boring watching this...."	1
8	An unusual series ! MUST SEE	"La casa de papel is a series with everything! It has plot twists ,a lot of action ,stress ,full emotions and above all passes good messages.

The only thing that keeps me from rating it with 9 is that it contains a lot of inappropriate scenes and that netflix has put some characters who could have been somehow better ..like Manila..

i totally reccomend it to all of you !!!"	1
1	Dumbest tv show of all time	Genuinely haven't a clue how this mess of a show became this popular.	0
1	Such a overacted title with a disappointing story	This series is total garbage, it should end by four episodes but no they decided to make money not by heist but by producing its four seasons and that's the heist yeah Characters are so dumb and stupid, and not to forget how it got stretched, horrible decision to watch it I need to donate my eyes now	0
2	Stop!	A good idea Is becoming a sequence of foolishness and repetitions. Basically a repetitive soap opera with guns.	0
1	Totally a waste of time and overhyped!	Don't bother watch this soap opera kind of heist, don't waste your time, it's not worth it, it's too unrealistic, no plot at all, terrible writers with exceptional cast, this used to be a good show couple of years go, now it turned out to be a meh and continue going downhill, stop the hype and please don't continue the season anymore. It should be the end totally.	0
1	I'm done	"Watching series 3 and 4 of this show made me cancel my Netflix subscription. They completely ruined what small positives there were. Find this is happening with more and more shows.

We were laughing at the insanely huge plot holes and the un-killable Gandia.

Netflix are the true professors of the world, robbing everyone or their time and money."	0
1	Ridiculously illogical	"What a shame, when building a character so-called ""Professor"" as a brain but the plan consists of many, many, many risks and illogical things.

Don't bother to list out here, took me to go thru 2 episodes to decide that I would never proceed to the 3rd one.

Don't waste your time, if you're older than 15."	0
2	I don't get it.	After season 1 I won't be watching any more. I felt that it had the weakest storylines intertwined with poor story telling, patronising product placement (mainly of Spanish beer), and mundane sets & outfits. Not to mention the endless pointless non-functioning character development make this a huge miss for me - it was just uncomfortable to watch, but if you like Spanish soap operas it might be for you.	0
1	Bloody bad	Total waste of your time season 3 n 4 never watch them...zero for these two seasons	0
1	Far fetched and bad acting	"Far-fetched, predictable, unrealistic, and really shabby acting.

The robbers are now going against each other, there's been at least 2 love stories all in the first 24 hours of a heist..

The fact that the robbers are now against each other and are lying to each other and going behind each others backs and trying to save the hostages is just so unrealistic and dramatic.

Now it's robbers vs robbers vs police vs love life drama #1 vs love life drama #2 vs hostages. Get in the bin."	0
1	Absolutely terrible	Do yourself a favor and don't even start this series. I pushed through season 1 and regret doing that cause I felt committed and had to see it through. What a disappointment and 17 hours of my life I'll never get back. The plot is poor, the storyline is predictable and the acting. Oh my the acting, just terrible. I actually was forwarding through episodes in the last season cause I knew by then what was filler and what was, and I use this term loosely, important. Just don't do it. You've been warned.	0
1	Bad for human and society!!!!	Watching this show (Money Heist) may encourage peoples/humans to do bad things more, like stealing money, etc. I hate to admit the show is good like 4/10 but bad for us.	0
1	Classic soap opera	Characters are so unbelievably dumb. Just don't watch it.	0
1	NOT WORTH WATCHING	This is probably the worst series I ever watched on Netflix. How is this so highly rated and popular is beyond my grasp. There is no logic, and the acting my most of the actors is terrible (esp Tokyo..couldn't even watch her scenes without skipping) And the lead inspector is the worst written character ever. Such a joke!	0

1	The worse in 2021, free Palestine	First and second parts were great. 3rd was ok, 4th worse. 5th won a 1 star from me. The forth and backs of the characters made it a very bad series.	0
1	Trash	Nothing more that a stupidity-meter device to measure the low level intelligence of population. And it works. 8.7/10!! Is this for real? Sic trasit gloria mundi.	0
1	The series for dummies	What is this??? This series has absolutely 0 credibility. The script must have been written by a bunch of 10 years old teens (they will forgive me), full of non-sense and totally incoherent. Characters are as convincing as dummies, with no past, no depth, no real personality. It looks like they were just taken out of a manga or borrowed from a cartoon, for the sake of their supposed coolness. This is a cardboard series. If you like being a fool and be treated as one, just watch and enjoy.	0
10	Awesome ever	Finished all the part 3 episodes in a single day..Now waiting for part 4 finale...	1
1	Plot holes, terrible writing, ridiculous characters. Absolutely overrated	This does not even deserve 1 star, should be 0 stars. It´s sooo bad. 20 hours I'll never get back. Ridiculous plot. The writing is terrible. How on earth did it get such a score? What a joke... Don't waste your time on this drivel. Now I understand why in Spain this show was a failure.	0
10	Plz watch only part 1 & 2	Don't watch after two parts otherwise you will be regret. They ruined everything in part 3&4.	1
2	Boring and ridiculous fairy tale movie ...	Boring, fairy tale film, nothing to do with reality, ridiculous.	0
1	Over-hyped, skip it	"I don't understand the hype around this!

actors are average, story is nothing special, visual effects or anything that can make you sit back and wait for the next episode are missing.

this was the first TV show that doesn't make me wanna see what happens next, even after dragging myself through the entire season 1.

I think I only watched it so far because I really wanted to understand the hype."	0
2	So predictable	The plot has very primitive line. First robbers have some advantage, after that police makes move and this cycle continues on and on. Moreover, all characters are invincible, they can get hurt but still continue to live. Please, don't waste your time on this.	0

9	Epic	"An epic series with intelligent script and intriguing characters. Amazing action keeps you focus in every single episode. This series have it all. Love ,hatred, action, suspense ,touchy and funny moments. A different action series with great interpretations from all the characters, many symbolisms about capitalism and socialism, ""bad"" and ""good"" people, awesome soundtrack and of course very intelligent scenario.

The negative for me is Netflix touch who launch LGBTQ messages in every single series even if it doesn't suit to the script."	1
9	Very good I watched the first 2 seasons, it's just perfect	It was a very nice series, I watched season 2, I just recommend it perfectly.	1
10	THE JOIN BEST SHOW OUT THERE WITH PRISON BREAK	I loved this show right from the first second with action from from the offset. All the seasons are intense and cliffhangers are at the end of every episode making you stay up all night just wanting to know more. I've watched it twice in English and once in Spanish and it was brilliant every time. Just waiting for part 5 now. The professor couldn't of been cast better, he is one of the best actors for his part and I love watching his insanely smart plans work out against the police and the army. ITS SOOOOOO AWESOME.	1
1	PARTS 3/4 AS BAD AS PARTS 1/2 WERE GOOD	"The first series was intelligent, fun and full of surprises. The second series was as if a bunch of students were given a project to redo the entire series, got drunk or high, and produced this swill.

So much talking and terrible acting trying to evoke emotions but given the absolutely ridiculous plot and even worse dialogue. Fail!!!

Just awful!!"	0
10	What an Epic Show It is	Probably the best show ever made Eagerly waiting for the season 4	1
9	Season 4 is boring	The first 2 seasons were fantastic, I can give 8 out of 10 you can even watch the 3rd , I can give 7 out of 10 But the 4th season is not gripping , not a good plot and dragged a lot . So I'm giving 4 out if 10. They should end this series in season 5.	1

1	FREE PALESTINE ✌🏼🇵🇸	SHAME ON YOU SUPPORTING ZIONISTS! The Zionists have no right to the land of Palestine. There is no place for them on the land of Palestine. Palestine is the issue, and until this issue is resolved, you don't deserve support. The Palestinians are victims of the zionist israeli genocidal actions; their lands are confiscated or deprived of water supplies in the semi-desert areas, and their homes are destroyed with heavy wrecking equipment. SHAME ON YOU TO SUPPORT ISRAEL AND ZIONISIM.	0

1	Too much overrated	The show is too much overrated and dragged for a long time. The last season 5 is nothing but a shooting practice and slow mellow drama.	0
1	Boring and the acters are stand with bad government and politcs	"This series was intended to stand with the oppressed of class systems, politics and bad governments. But it became clear that he supports and perpetuates injustice and darkness through his support for Israel.

26 out of 30 found this helpful."	0
1	Bad	I do not recommend this one It containts inappropriate scenes that incite to violence.	0
1	If it was the only show lift in the world i am not gonna watch it	To be clear the first 2 seasons were fine , and then the show dramatically slides down the cliff, don't waste your time , and they r trying to but weird thing every were possible.	0
1	bad	Bad stupid show with a low quality and bad actors.you should watch orphan black or blind spot better that this.	0
1	Free Palestine!	"Free Palestine!

Freedom for Palestine.

Free Palestine!"	0
1	Not good	Encourages robbery and and all sorts of illegal activities in the name of justice, why would anyone steal public money from a bank and take it for themselves instead or giving it to the poor if they call it justice. I wouldn't be surprised if this show bred more burglars and thugs. Also the actors are hypocrites they are Zionists, if they truly are just they should have supported the Palestinian cause.	0
1	Season 3 and 4 are just a waste of time	Season 3 and season 4 are garbage compared to the first 2 seasons, should have ended after season 2.	0
1	there's no logic in this show!	"So you want to tell me that professor black mailed police just to stop the second attack when he could ask them to stop both attacks?

And you want to tell me that 3 robbers fight way better than a team of experienced soldiers? They could easily use a grenade.

There are many problems like this in the movie. You may not understand my frustration, but anyone who has been in military or have been in a gun fight will."	0

2	Definitely not should've stopped after season 2	"Same nonsense again and again they dig them selves in the story and in next season, oh yea the professor was aware of what the police would do and of course always there's plan B,C.

To summarize don't it after season 2 end it there for your own sanity."	0

1	Irrelevant Politics	Mixing political views with TV drama to brainwash the uneducated viewers, talking about the occupation of Palestine.	0
1	Worst cast	It's so disappointing how the cast showed up at the most oppressive country tv show, Israel (the stolen land Palestine). Definitely you just lost a fan!	0
9	Thrilling and very original	Usually can't stand to watch something in another language, but with this action packed series couldn't stop watching episode after episode. Can't wait for the next season, and how come netflix hasn't uploaded the last two episodes!	1
1	Teenage trend	Childish plot, totally unrealistic and full of plot holes. Mr professor should give us the lottery numbers as it seems he knows everything before it happens. The perfect robbery is getting the money and escape as soon as possible. On this earth at least...	0
1	Unbearable!	No spoilers here, unless we're talking about spoiled garbage. What garbage, and that's being a bit unkind to actual garbage. It doesn't really deserve to be associated with junk like this movie. The acting sucked, and for a while I thought it would turn into a parody movie but to my disappointment it didn't. Maybe I'm too spoiled by good shows, but I could not believe this show is for real.	0
1	horrible unrealistic show	Everything in this show is just obvious. every character in this show is acting stupid! you cant connect with anyone. i really wonder why a lot of people like this show.	0
1	honestly just watched first episode	After seeing a guy with a laptop hacking security system ..... this was way toooooooo fake , i couldn' t watch this stupidy	0
10	Fantastic	It was fun and wonderful and the plot of the story is beautiful	1
10	A very good series.	A very good series, I never watch series otherwise but this one was good. Drama, love and suspense make the series good and good characters and music. Looking forward to seeing the next episode 😀. Would imagine seeing about this series again.	1
2	Fully of bs!!	"All the characters in this series are idiot. I expected to see some smart people solve some hard puzzles. But there are only problems created by idiot characters. And these problems are getting solved by another idiot, the professor, with the most idiotic way.

Stay away from this series if you think you have couple of brain cells."	0
1	Absolutely horrible	Speechlessly bad!! Can't believe I wasted so much of my time watching the first 2 seasons.	0

1	All of you must read my following review	"Actors have made big mistake by supporting the last occupation in the world, Israeli Zionist occupation .

10	One of the best series in the world	This is one of the best series in the world and this line says tha all.	1
10	What language are you watching in?	"I'm confused by all the ""bad"" reviews. Are they watching in the original language because the dubbed version is trash. I don't know why anyone would watch if it's not the original actors. The acting is really good by the way. People saying it's not, uncultured fools. Anyway, it's a great show."	1
10	It's awesome	Now this webseries is my favourite lst episode is very kelling.	1
10	I'm glad they didn't stopped at season 2 :)	"😎 WEHN EVERYTHING IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE 😎

Finally found something awesome after these many years.

I like the football references The best scene was when they finally reached the dirt inside the vault and start singing and other crew member came and join them, huh Awesome.

I don't like the Tokyo character, she's too much and unstable all the time.

All actors and actresses are just superb and amazing and great and hmmmm out of words :)

Can't wait for season 5

Ps: Watch the main version (Spanish) with sub, because the dubbed one is super bad 🤢"	1
10	The 100 out of 100 of my life	"I already reviewed this amazing show a year ago.

After a year, I return and again see the hatred towards the alleged HYPE that many viewers out there feel about La Casa de Papel.

To all lovers and haters, please know, that's the only series that I would give a 100 if I could.

It is that great, that amazing and that impactful.

Happy binge-watching the first part of season 5 in September!"	1
10	Nice movie	From season 1 to season 4 is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 All this people writing nonsense review about this Tv show can't really see because before you watched this Tv show you people saw the title, please before you start writing any bad reviews watch it very well and understand.	1
10	Amazing	Very good story Professor love story are amazing good good good.	1
10	The best heist series I've ever watched!!!	I dare to give the best rating, because this is the best crime series I've ever watched!!!. This series is a fairly light story, but there are heavy parts too. There are plot twists that sometimes we don't think about. The genius of the professor will amazed us. By watching this, I became quite fluent in Spanish, and let us know all the stories and reasons from the robber's side. Once again, this series is a must watch!!!	1
10	One of the best Content	One of the most fav web series ever this web series it lit .best web series on netflix.	1
1	Over hyped show	This show is over hyped.. may be for the users who just purchase Netflix subscription and see this show in trending shows. There are lots of plot holes and weak story.. compare to breaking bad, narcos , fauda this show is just for the kids not for adults	0
1	illogical	If you want to see a show which is completely illogical the go for it	0
3	More for kids	Last season is like a kid's story....it was my waste of time	0
3	Poor Sesson 1 ..... ...unnecessary stretched up, could have been end it in 5 episode....😔	Poor Sesson 1 ..... ...unnecessary stretched up, could have been end it in 5 episode....😔 5 to 6 episodes are enough to show all things in proper way 😓	0
3	Chewing gum !	I would love to give this series 9/10 if the series not stretched like a chewing gum, sweet in the beginning but now no juice remaining. It could be contained in one or maximum two seasons. I'm surprised at Spain police capability ,criminals are going in & out like a shopping mall & they are looking like a spectator, amazing!	0
3	Stop hyping Show	Stop hyping show you morons. There is nothing special about it. Stupid people!	0

10	A ride full of thrills and surprises	Brilliant show - brilliant story - brilliant acting - i would say one of the very few shows that hooks you up like nothing. Let's hope the upcoming seasons are even better.	1
10	Amazing!	Great story, directing and fantastic acting. You cannot stop watching!	1
10	Mind blowing & Unpredictable !!	Like watching a Chess game playing by 2 Grand Masters. Every move is calculated in advance. Every episode is nerve breaking. Climax episodes are terrifically screenplayed.	1
10	Solid 10!	This series is masterpiece tv series on criminal genre after Breaking Bad! So freaking love!	1
1	ignore high rating, it is way off	I watched 3 episodes and here my description of this title: a dumb professor hires a bunch of dumb paranoid impulsive criminals putting the biggest idiots in key roles of the heist hoping that these imbeciles can follow his plan and no, it is not a comedy. The whole thing is just too dumb, I agree that it is definitely original, in the dumb way. If you watch Ocean's Eleven 11th time you get a lot more entertainment then this parody. This does not even deserve 1 star, should be 0 stars.	0
1	Bad, boring and BS	"After watching 4 episodes I went back the the ratings on Google, I just cannot understand how this is ranked so hi, other than these are false reviews. This series is absolutely ridiculous, the writer director just fills up 50 minutes of mindless dialogue with a boring storyline and then says "" cut "" What a waste of my time and the producers money. I am starting to get the feeling Netflix just wants to produce hours and hours of content and nothing of quality. Shame on you Netflix!"	0
10	Absolutely awesome!	One of the best series I've seen in a long time, it's exciting from the first to the last episode, I love it! Berlin character for me was the best, I had some great laughs with him.	1

Even if you're not, still watch it. Anyone hating on it simply lacks the capacity to fully understand how much research and development goes into a show like this. The writing and cast is second-to-none. 10/10."	1
10	Superb Masterpiece	Amazing series, loved it from the heart. Entertaing should binge watch whole series.	1

2	I don't get the good reviews	"I am just finishing season 2 and I don't get the hype. Acting is really bad, love story is cringe worthy and character development is really messy.

I carried on watching it to see if season 2 will get any better, but no."	0
1	embarrassment and copy	Do you remember the movie Inside Man? This is what a professional leap looks like. What we will see on the screen is an inept attempt to copy an idea. Several months of robbery planning take their head by stupid mishaps. Errors that nobody would make after planning for several days. Artificially generated problems. And the scene where the hostage acquires a weapon without a magazine, reloads and targets the attacker. 🤣 embarrassment.	0
1	Lost the plot	Started off as a brilliant thriller but lost it's course after few episodes in series 1. The script makes the characters so stupid or dumb and some plots are so unbelievable. I had to stop watching and turn BBC news on which had more gusto.	0
10	One of the best tv shows of all time!!	So I didn't watch this show because it was in Spanish and knowing that there was still an English version, I didn't think the English version would match up. Let's just say this is by far the most impressive tv show I've ever watched. I compare it to Prison Break, it's that good and that intense! There's so many things that happen, it definitely keeps you guessing and wanting more! I just started season 3 and I can tell you I don't want to stop watching! The things that happen are insane and the Professor is immaculate!	1
10	The best series I've ever watched	I'm completely in love with this tv show. I just finished the 3rd season in one day, I am just addicted of this show. Extraordinary actors, story, message, everything. This season made me so emotional , you fall in love with every single caracter. I can just say MASTERPIECE!!! Can't wait for season 4!!! #BELLACiaoo Come back soon guys	1
10	Must watch	I normally don't post a review, but this is one of the most cliff hanging shows and it attracts you immediately. The professor is a G and you have to watch it.	1
10	Excellent	I just finished the new part 3 Can't wait for a new season I love it	1
10	Unexpected ending	"#MoneyHeist Heavy season 3 unexpected ending.

Thoroughly enjoyed it

Definitely season 3 has the toughest Hiest they had & it's gonna hook you up till the end as same as Season 1&2 made you.

SPOLIER nairobi injured

They confirmed Season 4 & Can't wait for it."	1
10	Brilliant!!	"WOW! JUST WOW!!! I just finished Season 1 and 2 of this series and I am hooked! I cannot wait for Season 3! Each and every episode keeps you hooked, I had to continue watching episode after episode! To all the reviews about characters ""not doing their job"" yes things do not go to plan and characters do things to jeopardise the plan however if everything went to plan it would not make a good series and keep it interesting. Love love love this series!!!"	1
10	One of the best	Just nothing to say, don't miss this, each episode contains the same thrill and excitement, until the end.. vamos	1
10	Best International Series	One of the Best of the Bests Internation TV show I have ever seen...I could not miss single moment from the episodes.	1
10	Perfect work!	A well played roles by great actors shows hidden resistance messeges against the unjust system makes you feel the robbers have the absolute right to survive the police. Every single detail in this work has significant meaning Congratulations to the Actors, Writer and director and all the teams with all respect for what they produced. A10/10 is not even enough.	1
10	A fascinating thought	Many films have been made with this genre, but this serial has everything .	1
10	better than great	A show that greats no matter the language it's watched in. the characters are great, the plot is exquisite, and the show provides continuous entertainment.	1
10	Insanely amazing!!!	I'll probably never see anything so good again, i didn't see the English version, but man was this extremely brilliant and I 200% recommend!!!	1
2	absolutely overrated	"Bad Story. Bad plot. Bad characters. This is the worstest series I´ve ever seen. I just gave two stars for the sharp images ... ;)

All charakters want be professional hijackers or professional cops. But I never ever saw a movie or a series with so many stupid characters. They occupied a bank. For days. OK. And the cops don´t cut of the energy supply of the building??? Seriously?? lol."	0
10	Best show ever	I started watching it due to how well everyone talked about this show, and let me tell you I was impressed. Great acting, plot, soundtrack...A true masterpiece that kept me begging for more. Keep it up Netflix	1
10	Amazing	This show is amazing, truly a piece of art. It is extremely hard to stop watching this show, it nabs you and settles you in for a great ride.	1
10	You can't stop binge-watching this!	"This is addictive to the point that you don't understand how you've watched it all at once.

It's unpredictable, it's suspenseful, it's twisted, it's AMAZING!

Why it has so many mixed reviews here I really don't get it. Probably because of some inaccuracies with the plot.

I for one sometimes need a show that gives me those extreme emotions. This was one of them, I enjoyed it a lot."	1
10	Only idiots will give less review	If you have sense give this show the credit it deserves. Never give bad reviews because of your personal grudge. Professor is love , Berlin teaches trust & Aurturo is shameless basterd.	1
1	Garbage Heist	"Please stop with the ""this is the greatest show ever"" because it's complete trash. Too much B.S. that no criminal would ever be involved in, people who actually like this have zero understanding of how the real world operates, hardened criminals don't behave in this manner, nor do normal adults, they act like grade school children, and there's way too much I think I'm brilliant going on here, the premise is a absolute rip off of Spike Lee's Inside Man, now there's a great heist movie."	0
10	Wow	One of the best series I've watched. The acting, the story just all done so well.	1
10	Best	Great show the best in netflix. Can't wait for a new episodes	1
10	Magnificent	If there is a spanish TV Show you can't miss, so its definitly this one. It gets you into finishing an episode after the other. Totally recommend it, can't wait to see whats coming in season 3.	1
10	adorable	This is one of the best shows i have ever seen . it has so much thriller . i never felt bored for a moment . i just didn't like it had many adult scenes so i couldn't watch it with my family .	1
1	Plot is 0	I don't understand the high ratings on this show,plot is a mess!	0
4	Absolutely amateur show.	No smart writing. Tokyo is such an annoying character. So is the professor. Could've done it better. They could learn a thing or two from shows like 24, Prison Break etc. No thrill whatsoever. It's a very average show. Only people who can find it thrilling are people who aren't familiar to this genre and haven't watched a lot of masterpieces.	0
1	Worst	OverHype.... Foolish & Melodramatic..... too many Flaws......streched.....	0
1	Title Should Be Overrated Plot Holes Heist	Plot holes, terrible writing, ridiculous characters. Absolutely overrated	0
10	Just a great show!	I did not expect that season 3 will be so good! Great dialogues, nice scenery, very good cut scenes and cross story telling. You can watch the whole season in one breathe and that speaks for itself. I just can recommend the 3rd season and also the rest of c.d.p. a lot!	1
10	ADRENALIN RUSH UBERLOAD!!	Can't wait for Season 4! I wish they would give us more episodes and don't leave us hanging! It delivers, its exciting and I really hope we'll get more of Money Heist soon!!!!	1
10	Únete a la resistencia!	"Modern Robinhood gang! With EL S.D mask! EL SALVADORE DALI MASK!! Its never about the money, its about the system.

Which is more evil? To rob a bank or to invent one? In 2011, the European Central Bank made 171 billion Euro out of nowhere. Do you know where all that money went? To the banks. Directly from the factory to the pockets of the rich. Did anyone call the European Central Bank a thief? No. 'Liquidity injections,' they called it. The Dalis make a liquidity injection, but not for the banks. #bellaciao"	1
10	Masterpiece	This is one of the best series ever.Each episode is very thrilling and it never dissapionts.Best series ever it so clever.	1
1	Stupid people everywhere	Netflix paying the reviews. Waste of time. Unrealistic.	0
10	I'm in love!	I think Spain just kicked Hollywood in the nuts. This show is so incredibly intelligent, I want to marry it!	1
8	"""Es papel"""	"Despite some of the more ridiculous contrivances, I appreciate how suspenseful and entertaining this series can be, and being able to keep that up through the series as well as La Casa de Papel is a great feat. Even better, they managed to wrap it all up with a satisfying ending that... what... there is gonna be a series 3?

Viewed in Spanish language with subtitles."	1
10	Legendary	This season is LEGEN wait for it DARY. One of the best season. 10 out 10 rating.	1
10	Brilliant!	I'm not one to binge watch serials but this is a must watch! You never know what's happening till the end, twists and turns galore. The acting is top notch and I recommend watching it in Spanish with sub titles, just gives a better feel and gets you more involved.	1
9	Awesome	I loved it , it is fun and you just want to know what is going to happen in the next episode I read some of the reviews, maybe it has a few flaws not perfect, but it is fun to watch. I truly enjoyed it Also I do not understand why some persons think that the good reviews are paid by netflix, every one of my friends who saw this show liked it , so it must be kinda the majority of the opinions	1
1	Super sexist show	This show is super sexist. Anyone who cannot see it is either blind or just believe in a male-dominated world, and you can't reason with those type of people. I started to watch it, because a lot of people recomanded it. now I should take a closer look at who are my friends.	0
10	Awesome!	I think it's Really Awesome in every angle. All of actors were very professional & perfect.	1
9	Pitch perfect	"Great series! Writing, acting, characters are on target. Crooks are both smart and dumb, like real criminals. You get to know the characters and come to like some from the start, like others early and then come to dislike them and two of them (for me) were never likeable (one a weasel, the other a bully). The plot twists and turns and leaves you wondering how this new problem will be resoved. Delightful.

I recommend against binge watching this. Watch an episode a day -- kind of like a wonderful piece of candy once a day -- it's a treat."	1
10	Mind blown repeatedly.	This show is an unrivaled masterpiece. I want to give it a 12/10. I found it on a complete whim and was drawn in immediately. If subtitles aren't your thing, fear not, you'll forget they're even there halfway through the first episode. The acting is superb, the storytelling is insanely wonderful and the number of left turns this thing takes will literally make your head explode. i can only hope a part 4 is in the works. I want more and more and more of this, please.	1
2	I feel scammed	"I don't know why there are so many positive review seriously... Watched the whole season before writing this. Acting is very good but...the plot is not. Most of the robbers reactions are stupid. If what you want is watching high quality content don't watch this. There's no social criticism or whatever...really.

SPOILER : Tokyo's voice over will spoil the end of the show on episode 1 in the first minutes."	0
1	Plot holes	Like one reviewer said, if you enjoy stories with countless plot holes, unlikable/irritating characters, bad acting, pointless monologues, and complete nonsense, then this is a must watch. Season 3 is worse. if you want to enjoy it, turn off your brain.	0
2	"Copy of ""inside man"" of Denzel Washintong and Clive Owen"	"This show is too much alike to the movie ""inside man"" of 2006 in wich Denzel Washington and Clive Owen make a perfect interpretation. The same turns... and the same tricks to fool the police... there are so little differences. They could do something diferent but the copy the same thing. If you are thinking of watch this show... better see the movie ""Inside man"" that is way better than this one and is original. The performance of the actors are ok... Is well filmed.. But is a copy ..."	0
1	So many plot holes that u get bored at some point	It promises a lot at the begging, but it seams that as they wanted to make it more complicated they made so many bizarre mistakes and really nonsense scenes, that makes u wanna stop watching it immediately.	0
1	Amazingly terrible plots alert.	When I watched the trailer, I thougt it's goona be an interesting TV show. However, it is filled with studpid plots and the characters make tons of unbelivable mistakes. They seemed so professional in the trailer, somwhow they're just some dumb amatuer robbers in the show. If you really want to watch this show, remember turn off your brain when you watch it. Otherwise, you will be as mad as I.	0
10	Never leaves you off the hook	What an amazing TV series, it literally never stops to surprise! Great plot and plot development and amazing acting. The best I've seen so far, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	1
10	Best series I've seen so far	Do yourself a favor and watch this series. Mindblowing, speechless, amazing.	1

10	Don't take life too seriously - great show	"I can't believe the number of people rating the show so low and taking it so seriously like it was based on a true story or the producers are asking viewers to hand in their kidneys or their first born children.

Its just a fun fantasy show and all you need to do is sit back, relax and enjoy the ride. A great show that hasn't come from Hollywood should be celebrated.

I enjoyed every second of all 4 seasons and you will too. Can't wait for season 5 starting in a week. Fantastic show."	1
10	Money Heist	La Casa de Papel is a very good TV show overall. I really enjoyed it. The plan of el profesor, the narration by Tokyo, the relationship between characters. The two first seasons was very great. The third season, at the beginning, i felt that become more a fan base but when you watched it all the season it still have some great moments: mysteries, suspense, dramatic, funny, psychological moments. I recommend this Tv show. It was a very good experience overall. The season 4 have still some great moments and the end want to see the season 5 for sure.	1
10	Brilliant show	This is brilliant show of Netflix ,I don't why it's imbd rating 8.3 it should be 10/10.	1
10	Amazing web series ever	Waiting for season 5 . amazing mindblowing superb series ever .	1

10	Best ever series	Must watch all season. Really enjoyable web series.	1
10	Must watch!.	Amazing series!!!.Just avoid the hate review go and check it out amazing directions,cast,story.can't describe in words.	1
9	My rewiew	A very good production. I watched it without getting bored. I would recommend it to everyone. I am looking forward to Season 5.	1
10	More exciting trilling and waiting	It never seems to bore you. Maybe giving you about 31.5 hours (upto S02 ) of sitting at the thorn in the curiosity. Must watch and enjoy..	1
8	Completely Mind blowing	I'm highly recommended . Please watch and also say other. Waiting for next season.	1
1	Worst	More than worst. Just a fckng waste of time. Dont waste time watchinf this just watch 'Spartacus' and you will be amazed by seeing.	0
1	worssttt!!!	Everything is illogical in this show so much overrated	0
1	overrhyped	Why this show is so much hyped the rating of this show must be 6	0
1	Complete Nonsense	Worst directions worst story line but good acting, not worth watching	0
1	Beurkkkkk!	"This series doesn't make sense. Absence of logic. The police inspector in charge is the worse i've seen. They're talking about their plans at the coffee shop. It's a nightmare of a series. Potential was good, but lots of the scenes are illogic and wouldn't happened in real life. The robbers and police tactics is just not believable.

I rather watch an avenger movie, it made more sense. I'm not blaming the actors but the script. Somehow, they always find a way to get out of it.

Sorry it's a no for me!"	0
1	Utter nonsense	I don't even know where to begin, just 2 words 'skip it'	0
4	Criminal sympathiser series	1st season was good.. but once they come out of mint, how do they cross city border? How do they go out of country? Where do they hide 1 billion euros, in their underpants? When tokyo alone escaped they activated operation cage to block all city entry & exit points. They didn't do any such thing to save 1 billion euros & nation pride.. An honest police officer & honest mint employee suddenly support criminals for personal reasons	0
1	Overrated	It was ok for about a season and a half,but then they just started recycling stuff to make the show last longer,and they aded some weird superhero fearures to the charcters. In the end I started hating it because it was so overhyped.	0
1	This is embarrassing	First two seasons were good, good idea and good acting. later on this is lets take money wile we can. such big mistakes in script, rambo is little boy for few hostages. Arturo can make 2 times rebelion stab with scissors and come again inside and everybody is ok whit that. reality is no longer priority, let's make fake tension that way it would be better. You ruined good show, Money heist team you should change profession. Don't make trash like this anymore.	0
1	Worst acting and specially this naiive actor tokio	All events are expected not as sophisticated as prison break	0
1	4 episodes stretched into 4 seasons	I had high hopes when I started it but it was my biggest time waste it was like they didn't have good writers for more content thus they stretched 4 episodes into four seasons I don't recommend it's same if you watch first episode and last you won't find any thing different	0
10	The biggest heist in the history of mankind	The plot is considerable to the core, contains twist in ending of each episode. Also , the acting is strong enough to the carry out the role.	1
10	One of the best thrillers	Just completed the season 3 and can't wait for the 4. Just diabolically beast type of thriller TV series	1
9	What a great series	The actors snd actresses, the pace of the story... well done Spain, this is a great series. I will watch it again while waiting for n.3	1
10	10/10	One of the best tv series ever, full of drama . amazing acting from all the actors and actresses. It's a must watch series. Puta Mierrdaaa	1
10	Perfectly balanced	The most great TV shows series in the history, you will never boring	1
10	Very good observation of phychology	I loved this serial not only for the good scenary and details that kept me tied to the screen I also appreciated the psychological evolution of the characters, how they started to attack one another despite being good friends before. And also the behaviour of the prisoners and how they can change opinions under threats. Congratulations! Its been long time since i have seen a good film	1
10	Great!	I am not good at writing reviews. So, when I say this is a great show, believe me it is.	1
10	The brest of Netflix so far!	Excellent series. A must watch. Acting is great and so refreshingly different from the typical US shows dominating Netflix.	1
10	Heist with Thrilling mystery one of the best Heist Mobir/Tv plot	Series Starts with one aim and took turns in every episode, suspense and thrill portrayed very well ans and editing is outstanding which connects storyline.	1
10	Brilliant show	Acting +story line is superb .. must watch show if u have liked breaking bad n given 10/10 then its pretty much same	1
10	Awesome!!!	Love this series.. very good making, great actors, and a fascinating story! For everyone who loves series like prison break or breaking bad ist this a must see!	1
10	Perfect	Beautiful!! The whole serie is perfect with an good ending and good cast	1
1	Season 3 is a complete letdown	Everything has honestly become so cringe worthy and unrealistic that it's just so embarrassing to watch it anymore. I lose sight of the message they are trying to send with this show anymore, and it's no longer worth watching. Save yourself the time.	0
1	Please stop at season 4	Fot me season 1 & 2 was very good but when they get famously and announced seasons 3 its ok until that and now s04 is fully disappointed. #Please stop milking that COW	0
10	Its Chaos in Madrid and going to be a WAAARRRR!! in Season4	Recently watched season 3, and its just amazing. Its an adrenaline Ride. And the way it has ended, i am really looking for season 4.	1
10	Amazing.	One of the best series I've seen. Every single episode is more exciting than the other one	1
1	2 characters make this whole show unwatchable	"Well there are two characters ""Tokio"" and ""Rio"". They are literally piece of garbage."	0
1	Turn your brain off and watch it	Not sure how this got such a great review! Lot of plot holes. The Spanish police is portrayed as a very incompetent.( The snipers especially) I won't be happy at all to see such a series if I was a Spaniard!	0
1	Poor plot	My first points that I don't enjoy movies/ shows that are not consistent within their own universe. For example we have this professor who is supposed to be brilliant but obviously makes irrational/ stupid decisions. But there are many examples of such occurrences from different characters. Secondly I don't find the plot so original. They borrowed ideas from a few movies/ series and they put them together. I gave it a 1 because I find the 8.7 irrationally high.	0
10	Loved it	I mean i have seen hundreds of series all my life and this has definitely made a place in my top 5. I mean each character did an outstanding job with the role . There are few things which are hard to digest but other than that it was a perfect one.	1
4	Have potential but the execution is so bad	Cringey, plot holes, lazy writting, plot convenience, deus ex machina, too unrealistic, the main girl is boring and irrelevant, too much high school drama. Do not watch this, you'll waste your time.	0
10	Just awesome	One of the best TV shows I've watched so far. Excellent work ..	1
10	Best heist series of all time 🔥	People who are giving one rating probably don't know how to watch a TV show ..... Rip to them 😢	1
10	Mind blowing!	Wow this show is mind blowing I'm in love with each and everyone of them, every character had their own right with the scenes , the acting is top notch I applaud everyone for that brilliant performance, I'm in love with the professor period. Thank you so much for the amazing and hopefull ending, I know they are thiefs but they had my sympathy to wish they succeed in their operation.	1
1	Overrated	Probably the most overrated TV series I've ever seen	0
1	So overrated	I really can't understand what does one find in that show. Sloppy, full of voids and silly politics...	0
10	Ausm tv series	One of the best serious far better than many American TV series. Loved it	1
10	I'm mesmerized and sad, that it's over!	It's 4AM and I still want more! But wow just WOW. This was the best series I've ever seen. I don't even speak Spanish. How the director/creator put this together just amazes me that there's that level of brilliance out there somewhere. It's a series that will make you feel every emotion. It's a series that will make you click next episode even though you know you should be getting to bed. It's the only series that not only I've written a review for, but going to watch all over again, right away.	1
10	Best series since long time	My boyfriend and i got really caught into this series, it's just great and full of unexpected moments. You just can't guess what happens next. The actors are awesome, each one of the main characters plays their role so authentic. I love that Netflix used the original language and didn't double it in English, this way all the emotions are brought 100% into the series. Great job! Unfortunately we have to wait until 2019 for the next season :(	1
10	One of the best series	"I love it all!

Best Series after Breaking Bad.

It never gets boring to watch it. So sad there will be no season 3."	1
1	They support the apartheid state	"How can the heroes of a series against injustice and oppression support an apartheid state or what you call ""Israel""!! And they appear on their channels and hold talk shows with them! You are not really heroes, you are supporters of terrorism and all forms of apartheid carried out by ""Israel"". #FreePalestind 🇵🇸✊🏻"	0
4	Time heist...	The only thing they are actually robbing is your time of life. No idea how it came that bad after the first season...it could have been a good series.	0
8	About La Casa De Papel	If it wasn't for season 4, I would have given it a 9. What was that gun scene?	1
9	Everyone was amazing. The casting was done nicely and especially the professor was too good in his own personality and acting	Everyone was amazing. The casting was done nicely and especially the professor was too good in his own personality and acting.	1
8	really cool!!! exciting show	I think it's very exciting, there is always tense, the characters are really badass, i love them, so you can't resist to bing watch the whole series, of course there are tiny logic mistakes but you don't have to overthink it, and i'm not trying to normalize a heist in real life either just enjoy the show can't wait season 5.	1
8	Some people who gave retion 1/10 They did see well	So If me I gave retion 8, because they Action well then amazing powerfully,so I am waiting the next episode, for now I am still 50 50 because I don't know what could be the next episode 👍	1
10	Super show	I have watched all sessions and I am very grateful for creativity thinking for the direction.. what a story and implementing level is no one can beat... this show is full package of entertainment...	1
9	My favorite Spanish ever	Thank you Alex Pina 4 the great series. Season 1-2 are originally the telenovela TV soap opera style that is 2 heavy 4 my liking. Its not bad season but need the multiple viewing 2 understand what the heck is going on. Then season 3-4 is the netflix blockbuster action adventure with higher budget. This one easier 2 understand in 1 sitting. Overall, its still the great series 2 kill more time. Bring on season 5, baby.	1
9	Great	Such wonderful series, amazing script and production's on top. Quality never failed, and characters were interestely original; never quited watching it. I got to say it was kind of repetitive, but still, got both of my eyes stuck on the screen all the time.	1
10	Good hiest series	Money Heist is a very good show it is having a very good actor like falling if he is the more I like him the next one is the professor professor and his girlfriend Marino that is also very beautiful the other character that is to Q that is also very beautiful and I like this series it is full of suspense and thriller and action so everyone can enjoy without boring.	1
10	My opinion from The Money Heist	I love this serie, its incredible the serie is amazing, it doesn't has any error, its perfect.	1
9	La casa de paper / Money heist	Watched money heist few days back.simply it is a proffesor graph series in my opinion. Wow,superb words are not enough for this series Just Amazing .Eagerly waiting for 5th season.	1
8	This show is not that bad as it seems	"I would agree with what most people has been saying. It should have ended in season 2. But it doesn't deserve 1-5 rating.

This show has few boring parts compare to Breaking Bad. Not comparing tho! Money Heist may not be the greatest show but it is indeed the greatest heist show I have ever seen.

And it would be illogical to compare this show with Prison Break cuz PB is a completed series. Money Heist isnt. But I have high hopes that it will have an epic ending."	1
10	Wow	I never seen this type of series. It's my best series in the world,now just waiting for season 5.	1
10	Isaiah's review	Absolutely my favorite show, above and beyond, never knew what was happening it's a chess player show and I love it, always surprising you in some way, a recommendation for sure.	1
10	One of the best series i have seen in a very long time!	Fast paced, plot twists, amazing story... Mind blowing series.. can't wait for the next season!	1
10	If you are a Hollywood super-hero movie fan then, you will not like this.....	If you are a Hollywood super-hero movie fan, then you will not like this, the story line reflects a real life situations, ok some of the characters are dumb and behave erratically, but that also happens in the real world. For the people who rate this show poorly all i can say is, go watch spider-man or other movies alike. Can't wait for season 5.	1
10	The best series I ever watched...	It will take you to a joy ride of strong emotions which has thrill, love, suspense.	1
10	You mean Money Heist ( la casa de papel ).	"😍 Awesome I love it. Fantastic role of Professor. The whole series create Great situations on every Moment. I am really excited about next season.

Director Hurry up?????"	1
10	Masterpiece!!!	It's one of the best series ever i seen! Every episode twist and twist. I enjoyed all seasons. Waiting for next season.	1
9	Outstanding!	This show is awesome. Thriller, crime drama and a little bit of root for the bad guys.	1
9	Such an addictive show	I thought the whole show was excellent. Lots of user reviews thinking they know how to pull off a heist better, but I would definitely recommend :) will leave you walking round the house singing Bella ciao	1
10	Bloody brilliant	Not really understanding all the 1 star ratings on this show as it deserves nothing less than a 10. I'm not one to watch TV shows or movies in other languages, but this grabbed my attention from the beginning and had me at the edge of my couch at the end. Such an emotion felt series with a crazy storyline. Highly recommend to anyone who has the thrill for something exciting!	1
8	There was no need of season 3 &4	I very much enjoyed season 1&2. Season 2 ending was beautiful and they should have stopped at there. Season 3 is not that bad and Don't ask about season 4. Take my advice and don't watch s4.	1
4	Chiche	I can't fathom why people are hyping it. Its plain dumb and boring after 1st episode. Story is full of plotholes and devoid of logic.	0
1	What a load of rubbish	Who watches this tripe? Seems to be episode after episode of love triangles, people shouting over nothing, ridiculous love stories and an extremely desperate police detective. It's so slow and boring, can't understand the high ratings.. don't get me started on season 4.. all the women are smart and the men/police absolute fools? Terrible representation of Spain's military and police force. Just terrible and the action scenes are all bullets flying around with no reason. Also, too many plot holes that I don't know where to begin.. don't waste your time.	0
1	Professor OR Soap Opera Conductor.	Why there is a hype about this sitcom? Professor looks more like soap opera conductor. Too long and boring stories each character. Love and emotions of every character is not required to build the story. I kept the TV on and went to sleep after about 4-5 episodes. When I got up it was 9th episode and the heist plot has not moved an inch. Waste of time.	0
10	I'm bit confused	"I hope we never see season 5, please cancell this show, pleaseeeeee

This should be ended after season 2... season 4 is worse of GOT season 8...."	1
1	Last episode	This one pretty bucked up. Just stretching it somehow.	0
1	Don't get the hype around this TV series?	I've watched 2 episodes and I can barely make it to episode 3. It's THAT boring. And I live in Europe, where this show is supposedly popular (according to Wikipedia). I don't understand the hype around this show. Too bad, because the narration in the first episode was interesting, as well as the story.	0
1	Most over-hyped show and a waste of time	It's a total BS show and a complete time waste. The plot is too convenient for the robbers, the police is shown super stupid. Common sense is completely ignored to make the plot more dramatic. I don't understand how can it have such a good review at other places.	0
1	Useless. Over hyped.	I don't understand why this series so over hyped. Over emotions. Waste of time	0
8	Season 4 sucked	Season was just completely out if order and they tried so hard to make surprises and all that but they tried too hard.. The shooting scene was the worst piece of TV show I've watched so many bullets aimed at a dude with no cover and he survived.. RIDICULOUS	1
1	WORST THING I EVER WATCHED	It was so bad that i had to make an account onn imdb to leave my comment for this series. It is yucckkkkkk. literally the more i watched the more i was building up anger in me to watch world's most lame screenplay. Soo many emotions in one time. Every character sort of tooo dramatic in delivering dialogues. Even writing this rebiew right now i am angry. Piece of s*** Don't watch it guys or else u will want to kill urself i am telling u.	0
10	Marvelous Series	This is the most addicting series i have ever come across. If anyone has a slightest of interest in Suspense/Thriller/Crime then this is a go-gun for you. This series deserves everything appreciation and recognition	1
1	A good plot but ....	A good plot but writers over complicated it with unwanted, unnecessary and unrealistic twists. Honestly the whole thing should have ended in season 1 and be done with. They stretched it to a point of boring the viewers.	0
8	Season 4 is an awful addition to the series	"After two masterpiece seasons with epic plots that made the show really entertaining

Season 3 and 4 are totally seasons with alot of stretching in the story And at the end of the day season 4 Ended with nothing new"	1
10	It's a pity	Why did they create a masterpiece just to ruin it by stalling in season 4, money is the answer. It's obvious that they filled up 4 episodes chasing Gandia with one goal, to extend to a fifth season.. No more views money heist we resist...	1
4	Went down.	Wow how things moved up then down the ground. First 2 season were awesome, the third and fourth are just trash talke with no clue about the storyline. Should stick with just the first 2 seasons.	0
4	Season 1 & 2....Excellent, but Season 3 and above...poor	It should have ended at season 2. But the producers and Netflix wants to make more money. Season 3 and others are more like fantasy or fairytale kind of story. Time wasting.	0
10	Love it!!	I think money heist got extremely high numbers of fans from Pakistan. Love it we all do lots of love from Pakistan	1
8	Fantastic series dragged	"Season 1 & 2 were awesome 9/10 Season 3 decent 7/10 with superb fantastic finale 9/10 (for that episode only)

Now here Season 4 arrives and became very unrealistic and unnecessarily dragged. Could have been better. 6/10

Overall 7/10

Stop after season 2"	1
10	Show you must watch before dying	I have never rated anything 10/10 in my life but after watching 2 seasons of this which itself is complete i would say that this show is the best show i have ever watched till date. I don't want to watch the season 3 because i am afraid it will be not as great as the first two seasons but i can't stop myself maybe this show has more surprises who knows!	1
1	Hostages kindergarten	If i had such annoying hostages i wouldn't want this hesit no more	0
2	Brazil vs. Cameroon, Robbers vs. Police	Who do you think will win? Brazil. Who do you want to win? Cameroon. The Brazilian players are not very likeable. The players from Cameroon are not the brightest, but atleast nicer than the Brazilians. Oh, and the amount of luck for Brazil is reaching a 10 on the scale of laughability. Is a game like that fun the watch? No. I would advise you to watch a more fun game.	0
4	Overrated... Gets boring in first season itself	I think this tvseries is overrated. It's gets boring after initial 6th episode itself. The concept is great but the creators messed it up. If u can bare the first season second season is somehow beter. But for that one has to surpass the 1st season. Once thwy get inside to rob, it looks like they are on a vacation. I personally think this show would have made better with the great script it already has git, but it didn't get executed well.	0
10	An absolute brilliant work	It is one of the best series in the world. Great storyline and acting. once you start to watch it, you can't stop. you can't sleep without knowing what's next. If you really want to have a good time, go for it.	1
10	Absolutely brilliant sit back & enjoy the ride	Without doubt one of the best tv shows of all time. I have watched all 3 seasons in 4 days. I feel exhausted with so much excitement. Cannot wait for season 4	1
10	Perfection	One of the best series in action,crime and thriller. Love all the characters specially pedro Alonso's and also hats off to professor.Great work, best of luck for series future.	1
10	Its a must watch!!	This series is a complete package. With very good script, direction and acting this series makes you feel emotions of every character. I have seen few more heist movies but this is untouchable. Liked professor and Berlin's character the most. Tokyo was irritating at places.	1
10	About cliffhanger	So nicee.. very interesting,I recommend you watch,I enjoyed it very much when watched that cliffhanger	1
10	Mohammad Al Bilani	"In short, IT'S A MASTERPIECE!! 😍 Every single episode is full of suspense, you don't feel like there are any filler episodes.

Every single character is special and unique in his/her own way. You would easily feel interested to know more about their background story before the heist.

It honestly should be number 1 on IMDb for all the excitement and thrill this show provide you. From the very beginning of the show, from the first episode, it gives you a great first impression and it doesn't fail your expectations."	1
10	Bella Ciao	I would say this is great ... from the act.... to the tactics to the ideas ... to the music ... to the ending ... One of the best I have seen .... Bella Ciao	1
10	Perfecto !	Amazing characters , amazing writing & directing. The professor character was truly captivating. A story full of suspense, excitement & emotions. You must watch it & enjoy it.	1
10	The best i ever seen	I am fan of movies and series that show facts that are so close to reality and its the first time i ever seen something like that. It was so beautiful because it has a lot of drama, agony, death, laugh and love. By my opinion it was so good as the Titanic and Jurassic park. If someone does not seen this yet i consider to see it.	1
9	Great show!	"SPOILER: Season 1 is simply great. Why?

Great story. Great acting (by most) Great characters Great pace

There are some flaws here and there, true. But this is something one should watch with the mind switched off and see it as an adventure. If you look for the illogical and try to analyse the 'plan' one may as well skip this show.

Example: The tunnel being build 5 years before, toward a federal building. Complete BS of course. But really, who cares?

Just lay back and enjoy this GREAT ride...."	1
10	BRAVO! Well done!!	"A gem of a TV show. Part 1 and 2 were maganificent! Well written! acting was phenomenal! Binge worthy! This is in my top 3 best TV shows; along with GOT and DARK. This covers everything you need in a TV show with action, thriller, suspense, love, and bits of funnies especially with Berlin.

Ignore the negative reviews, trust me, I'm a stickler for reviews, watch it, this won't disappoint you. Thank you Alex Pina and others for La casa de papel. Bravo!"	1
1	Kindergarten class try to rob a bank	Extremely annoying characters like that kid from walking dead, all of them. The police inspector is especially annoying and incompetent. The hijackers behave like small children, constantly arguing and picking ridiculous fights. You start hoping they die. Constant monologues and unnecessary filosofical pauses. The police tent of operations is also open for all public to visit. And oh how the plot hole list goes on.... It has more holes than a swiss cheese. Should be in dictionary for overrated. To enjoy go see with zero expectations.	0
1	They probably never heard about demonetization	Anyone with even a basic understanding of economics won't be able to watch the stupidity unfold past the second episode. Everything feels forced and unjustified. Utter garbage! Two thumbs down along with my toes as well.	0
1	Bad series for reality lovers	The show is trying hard to be realistic although it is not at all .. overdrama about every situation .. you feel like episodes are empty nothing new . Plot holes everywhere . Unnesecerry conversations . Idea is new and acting is not bad .... nothing to be special . P.s : Its like an indian movie . Amazed of this high score .	0
10	The best ever till now!	This series was one the best ever thriller i have seen in recent time. It's was like an addiction to binge the entire series. The characters are extremely well chosen and they play an amazing part through the entire play.	1
1	Unrealistic Money heist	Makes Too often too less Sense. A Genius put the worst criminals you can Imagine, to the worst team you can Imagine. A love story, sry 2 love storys or 3!?, this is for fans of Twilight or csi new York etc	0
8	MASTERPIECE!!!	"BRILLIANT SERIES!!In every way ""la casa de papel"" is stunning!It describes the feelings of a common south European citizen at this time about the economy and society!Great actors!Great script!Great music!Great scenes!Great plot!10' from a Greek fan!!!"	1
10	There is comedy in this series it's called Pedro alonso	Pedro Alonso brings the comedy to this series...he is a phenomenal actor.i can't stop laughing when I see his acting what makes this series sooooo good.All the cast are very good but he is too good.i am addicted.	1
10	Loved it!	From the first episode it was perfect ! Everything was such well thought and placed in the series . Every episode revealed as much as you need to know but also built up anguish in order to keep watching it! Really waiting forward to see the next season!	1
1	Real Junk	The plot is full of loopholes, the rhythm is tardiness, and the acting is pompous, completely dishonor Netflix's reputation. Pinch my nose and shorten my pain by fast forwarding. I do not hesitate to give ONE star!	0
10	Drastically reeled me in, in love.	Yes there are a few holes clearly left wide about, but this is a very big storyline to fill. The show is so well put together for being such a great heist story. I fell in love immediately. The last episode of part 2 had me in overwhelming tears. That's when I know a show could not have possibly gone more perfect. I don't understand how there could be such negative reviews about it. It really portrayed an amazing eye opener to who really are the good guys and bad guys of certain criminal activity.	1
10	Epic tv show	Love it so much, and I am a very critical person when it comes to tv shows. But I definitely liked everything about this show, plot, music, and most of all the cast ! Amazing one !	1
2	The dumbest series I've ever watched	At first it seemed to me that the series had a very coassist idea, each hero has his own character and story. But already in the third series there were first doubts about the competence of the screenwriters of this show. I have not seen such stupid plot twists and such a number of love lines in any series about robberies. How this series got such a high mark remains a mystery to me.	0
2	So many flaws and holes!	"The holes in the scenario are SO many! There are things so unbelievable that it is obvious that are occuring just because the writers wanted to reach a predicament, they make no sense! First of all, the thieves leave the hostages alone all the time! Hostages try to help themselves escape in the most ridiculous ways, and no one hears them?? And all the while people are having sex with each other in there? And all the while the Police chick has time to go out on a date???

So very flawed it is hard to watch."	0
10	Perfect	This is one of the greatest Tv series that I have seen in the last a few years. I persistently recommend you to watch it :)	1
1	What's with the rating? Most overated show I have ever seen...	Soap opera with forced storylines that make no sense at all, plot holes bigger than craters on the Moon and characters that are just doing whatever they want in a show pretending to be smart. Most unrealistic character for me after seeing just the few episodes would be that police negotiator. What were the writers thinking? She would be replaced after the first day of that mess...	0
1	An indian movie is better	I've started to feel that I'm watching an indian movie. The huge amount of unreasonable scenes made me stop watching la casa de papel.	0
1	Hopelessly boring	Casa de papel is the most tedious boring series I have seen so far. The story rattles on all sides, the dialogues are uninteresting and unnecessary and the actor talent just isn't there. It is therefore a mystery to me why the story of Casa de papel should be spread over 4 seasons. Deserves no more than 4 stars.	0
1	Ridiculous	Ridiculous, unbelievable, boring ! Who cares of what happens to those thugs ? After 10 minutes, I was hoping they would all be killed. Stupid nonsense and waste of time. No interest at all. I really wonder why so many people find that contemptible story about contemptible characters....	0
1	An Absolute dumb series..	"Seriously what's wrong with the high ratings...

I cannot digest ,the cheif inspector ,knowing who the professor is ,but still playing like a teenage girl misled with love, and despite knowing the hanger address is there even an Iota of logic why Angel ( After recovering from Coma ) and the inspector not telling the others about that..?

This series for some reason make a mockery of viewers and couldn't even understand why it is getting these high ratings."	0
4	Truly overrated	Too many political correctness clichés (strong wamam, meanies bullies etc ...), a Netflix show bringing its political agenda to Spain. Anyway the real problem is that the show could be great but it is heavy flawed and get dumber every passing episode. It is a problem because the plot has a real huge potential. Basically the plot is based on the very elaborated plan of a mastermind (the professor) to rob a bank... great.... but he choses the worst people for the job (psychopath, hysteric girls etc ...). Eventually it doesn't make any sense.	0
10	Amazingly good show	This is truly one of the best shows I've ever seen. That may sound like hyperbole but it's not, it's really that good. Great story, compelling characters and outstanding acting.	1
10	best series ever!!	I really cry in the end,also the way it end and i canot see it anymore!!! i want mor season!!!	1
1	Really? (Facepalm)	"Please someone tell Tokyo to look at people and camera like a normal, usual human being not like an ox. Does she really consider her look sexy ? (I am gonna be sick) Inspector has only one expression for all situtations which makes me bang my head up against the walls

and yes the show is... (Now, I am vomiting)"	0

1	Cherish your time if you want to watch the S5	Come on just end on S2 ok? S5 is totally different style TV series, only gun fight? Just shooting and shooting~	0
10	Best Tv serise	Amazing robbery plan And writing for alixpin. I love this series im wating for seson 5 (3) September. And profeser it to smart person.	1
3	Complete Waste Of Time	"The premise had lots of potential. A well planned, carefully thought out heist the likes of which Spain (and possibly any other country) has ever seen.

Unfortunately it all starts to fall apart when they carry out the plan. Highly unprofessional criminals, stupid hostages, and an amount of drama that would rival any South American TeleNovela."	0
1	terrible... it starts going downhill from the 1st few episodes.. and then never stops...	"Overall.. it just terrible.

they start with a great concept & a very promising story. then it starts going downhill... and it never stops, going down hil...

toooo many flaws in the storyline... too many loopholes... to many love stories between people.

I mean are you there to rob and make money OR are you here to make love stories and relationships?"	0
1	4 season is for 0 stars	I am disappointed you didn't do nothing in 4 season better that I didn't watched ...	0
1	Totally waste of time	No any well coordination between team shown in the series. Max emotional drama. Totally time consuming series. Zero value addition.	0
1	Overestimated	I think it could be the most overestimated series ever. The first part - season 1, maybe season 2 also - were ok...ish, but now it's just lame and pure rubbish. Chuck Norris's movies have the potential of being more realistic.	0
1	Utter rubish	This series one of the worst I ve ever seen. Plot holes as big as black holes, very bad acting and shallow characters. It is hard to tell who are bigger idiots, cops or robbers.	0
8	It starts to get boring	The first two seasons were great! It was a very good plot and the whole story was perfect until the ending. Wit season 3 they did an okayish job I think and it was also nice to follow the new storyline. Season 4 is again one of this typical Netflix-bullsh...! They only try to make as much money as they can and the story is lengthened way too much! It starts to get boring!	1
1	Seriously?	Everything is just so mediocre in this TV-series....plot, characters, actors you name it. It only takes 20 minutes to realize you're watching total trash so you wonder....where's all these great reviews coming from?	0
1	If you think likelihood is important, don't waste your time on this one	The script doesn't make sense on so many levels that it's hard to believe it's not bad on purpose. But it isn't on purpose, it really tries to be umpredictable and clever, in the end it's only pretensious.	0
8	No words. Just wow.	"Words just can't describe this awesomeness of this TV show. It is so terrific, on a level comparable to Breaking Bad, with EVERY actor delivering OSCAR rewarding performances making all characters both likeable, loveable and remarkable, something very, very special only few shows were ever able to accomplish.

This show just will blow your mind."	1
8	Never thought season 3 would be this good	I wasn't expecting much after the end of season 2 but this season turned out to be great and intense to watch, the storyline was amazing	1
9	Roller Coaster RIde	If you want a never ending amazing ride then watch it	1
8	one of my faves	I loved it however i was extremely sad when Moscow died and i hope there will be another season.	1
9	Lovely	I love the professor's references to Greek music and history, the script is excellent. It's funny and serious, clever and few times emotional... The dialogues between Moscow and Tokyo was truly intelligent but Berlin stole the impressions. The whole cast was fine except Arturito and Alison (they are annoying). All episodes are interesting, full of action and doses of mystery. I'm waiting season 3, i believe it's going to be as good as previous.	1
10	Spectacular	This is definitely up there with the best series ever. It's an absolute thriller; you're always on edge. I watched it all in one sitting as I couldn't get myself out of the couch	1
3	Ugly	One of the most ugliest season in the history of serieses , very bad, don't watch season 5.	0
1	Trash!!!	Too slow ,, filler season 3 not gonna watch next season plzz dont waste time on this i bet there are lots of other shows which are better than this trust me it is overrated and meant for newbies..	0
2	please stop	I would rate the first 2 seasons 8/10 and season 3-4 2/10 the ruined a beautiful show with the boring drama and flashbacks.	0
8	I came here to change my rating 9 to 8 after part	, It is unfortunate to see this TV show turn into a business show, Part 4 8 episodes Why? A lot of the events like stuffing and stretching ... to see what the upcoming seasons will bring	1
1	OVERRATED!	Better shows didn't have a 8.5 notes some are just spamming that 10/10 rating for no reason. First and second seasons were quite good i'd give them 8/10, third season felt like wasn't needed and the same thing happened over again it's netflix wanted to invest in this show so bad so they will make profits off it i'd give it 5/10 and finally the season 4 is mediocre literally 8 episodes could be all resumed in 2 episodes at maximum 2/10 So i will be giving this show 5/10 or 6/10 at maximum. So Overrated having notes like 8.5/10	0
3	Netflix ruined the show	Season 1&2 good 3&4 Just trash Just make it longer & boring	0
4	La case de papel	In Money Heist there is action, some twists unbelievable and some fleeting romance ridiculous. But that is not credible, the character, the bounce and the decision takes : everything is false, everything seem illogical. I find it Money Heist mostly at the end.I find that a series too overpriced.	0
4	Critic of Money Heist	In Money Heist there is action, some twists unbelievable and some fleeting romance ridiculous. But that is not credible the character, the bounce and the decision takes : everything is false, everything seem illogical. I find it annoying. There's a lot of inconsistency in Money Heist mostly at the end. I find that a series too overpriced.	0
1	Unconvincing and Weak Onesided Storyline	Somehow on a beautiful plot they were able to mess up the story line. It seems like the guns police have are not working, and the police dog can't smell, making everything one sided without any logic or proper reasoning. I am rather mad on this than disappointed.	0
10	One of my all-time favourite shows!	Found this octane show on Netflix by chance and fell in love. Absolutely amazing cat and mouse game with an abundance of thrill, intrigue, twists, creativity and fun. A heist show like no other! Eagerly waiting for season 3. This Spanish show is dubbed in English which makes English subtitles redundant. Highly recommended!	1
3	Predictable	Halfwas season two, I think the series is predictable and the story is too long. It feels like they could have done two seasons in one easily.	0
10	Season 3 Episode 8 is the best	This episode is so good now waiting for the next season badly!	1
10	It's just great	This show is probably one of my favorite shows of all time, because I ussaly like binge watching shows but when it comes to la casa I can't just watch one episode and stop I have to watch the entire season at once. Which is great but then you feel so empty after the show Finishes because the show is just an amazing masterpiece.	1
10	Season 3 is an emotional roller coaster	Captivating yet mind blowing! speechless honestly, words can't express my thoughts but one question season 4 ???? y'all can't end season 3 like that , questions are invading my mind nonstop	1
10	Best Ever!	Hands down best series I have ever seen. Watched the whole of the second season in 2 days, truly brilliant! Actors, stroyline, directing everything! My go to series to recommend.	1
2	Very overrated with a lot of nonsense	This is one of the most overrated shows I have ever seen. Full of non sense, the Spanish security authorities should stop this series because it visualizes them as some idiots. Imagine the investigation of this kind of robbery is led by a lady how is the sexually hungry and can sleep with someone she just met three days ago. A very week woman and awkward man (Angel) next to her are investigating the robbery of the place printing Euros!!!. Some co-incidents are fabricated to prolong the serious and continues the scenes. Overall, very awkward piece of work.	0
1	Waste of time	Ridiculous plot. 20 hours I'll never get back. The characters are thin and shallow. The cops are all made to look completely incompetent. The writing is terrible. The actors do the best they can with a poorly written plot and script. Don't waste your time on this drivel.	0
4	Just to watch and forget	Frankly, I'd love to see them caught or killed. I root for the police here. That's how much I dislike the characters. And guess what? Nairobi is not going to die, duh!	0
10	OUTSTANDING	IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED IT YOUR MISSING OUT. greatest TV sho since 2017	1
10	Awesome series	I just finished this on Netflix and what can I say. This series is a masterpiece. The professor is really good. Anyway, i really enjoyed watching this, you should try too.	1
10	Masterpiece!	One of the best series I've ever seen! action in every episode, and the level of drama is maintained until the very last minutes	1
1	boring	Boring same story first 2 season only good nad other copy paste.	0
1	It become really bad	"When I finished season 2 I gave it 10 stars because it was really amazing. Then, everything changed.

The story for season 3 onwards is really bad and it damaged the full series. Netflix really destroyed the show.

I cannot give it 10 stars anymore. So I will give it 1 only so they understand their huge mistake."	0
3	Should have finished in season 2-3	"Season 1: 8 Season 2: 7 Season 3: 6 Season 4: 3 Season 5: 1

The more I watched, the less i liked it. Season 5 is a waste of time. Assault has no goal at all. I still did not understand what they were looking for. It is Only back and forth and a lot of fire like RAMBO. No strategy, illogical action, truly painful to watch..."	0
1	Disgusting	The crew supports Israel, an illegal state that commits genocide, ethnic cleansing, occupation, violated many UN resolutions (The UN has taken no action)	0
1	First 2 seasons best ,3 ok, 4th & 5th really worst	It should have been just about heist but unnecessarily they have changed into a war story. 5 th season first 5 episodes really worst flashback scenes are just like fillers to complete 10 seasons so irritating seeing those unnecessary flashback.	0
1	Worst season after GOT.	It so bad that now I have respect for GOT last season. The new season is worse than any bollywood masala.	0

3	dont feel like watching more	I dont know the whole series was good, this is about season 5. I just feel you cannot just kill a main character like tokyo like that, i feel she was the light of the whole series. I dont know man i dont feel like watching this anymore haha.	0
1	inhumane	Those who practice ethnic cleansing should not be championed.	0
9	Amazing	"Fight scenes could be more realistic.

Nicely dubbed in english."	1
10	Must Try Series	"I'm Still Waiting For Season 5 Upto Season 4 this Series had made a big foundation or a bond between a fan and series!

That's Why Its A Must Try Series!"	1
10	La casa de papel	Casa de Papel is a very good TV show overall. I really enjoyed it. The plan of el profesor, the narration by Tokyo, the relationship between characters. The two first seasons was very great. The third season, at the beginning, i felt that become more a fan base but when you watched it all the season it still have some great moments: mysteries, suspense, dramatic, funny, psychological moments. I recommend this Tv show. It was a very good experience overall. The season 4 have still some great moments and the end want to see the season 5 for sure.	1
4	Overrated piece of junk	Idk why people are crazy about this show. It's been copied from the oceans movies and stretched like a rubber, they should have ended it with season 2 it is just like an ordinary soap opera excluding common sense having too much of melodrama.	0
4	For god's sake, Stop all the nonsense and end the show with season 4. 🙏	First two seasons are great but it's getting boring from season 3, it's all soap opera. They're crying and making love and being stupid, where the hell is your criminal professionalism?? It's a show about heist, all the planning and execution, clever strategies, action, thriller and you're showing love stories, increase in family members, breakups, all kind of teenagers drama. Tokyo-Rio is the most annoying characters. You're all criminals, act like one! Stop with the 4th season, you're ruining a good show.	0
10	Perfection	My god this show is amazing . It's thrilling emotive dark funny shocking surprising and very very clever the best thing I have watched in a long time it's a must watch for anyone.	1
9	THE PERFECT SERIES	It's perfect series because the actress,idea,location and direction are very perfect	1
8	Waiting for the next season....	One of the best series that I ever watched.Fell in love with the characters.An awesome creation...Eagerly waiting for the next season	1
1	Cheesy, irrational, fake	One of the worst shows I have seen. Terrible acting, irrational plots with no logical progression, cheesy side plot discussions, you name it. Actors start crying for no reason, daddy/mommy issues spring up in the middle of a robbery, they bicker with each other nonstop in useless side plots. Don't waste your time.	0
8	STOP AFTER SEASON 2	"9.5/10 FOR THE FIRST TWO SEASON

very interesting series with pathos despite some little sensible passage in the plot in my opinion

6/10 FOR THIRD AND FOURTH SEASON

a useless continuation for a series that would have been perfect up to that point. the characters seem to be transported in a telenovelas as beautiful. the plot is flat. Such a pity"	1
3	Unrealistic on so many levels	Plot is far too contrived, the acting is weak and non of the characters have any bite, these are supposed to be hardcore career criminals! Whoever thinks this is close to reality has led a very sheltered or privileged life. I Stopped watching after two seasons as it had turned into little more than a soap opera.	0
4	It was nice until season 2	After season 2 money heist loses all the glamour there was no reason for another season... however it is worth seeing the first 2 seasons but don't watch at the other 2 if you want to keep a nice memory of this My rate is for all the seasons that why you see 4 out of 10 My rate for the first 2 seasons is 7 out of 10	0
8	It all went downhill after season 2	Season 4 is the worst. I'll point out somethings 1. We don't need a boring recap of a character who has to the present. 2. The show writer distorts the story of previous seasons to create money-making new season Which is not good. 3. Just because of the first seasons on the fanbase has created a hype which will get killed by boring season like the 4th one. 4. No intelligent writing and really stupid character except the professor. 5. It's difficult to love a character. I literally laugh and enjoyed when one main character got killed in season 4	1
4	Relative good but faaaaaar too long	Nice film with good plots and twists. But far, far too much of unnecessry kissing and hugging, emotional scenes dragged beyond limit and other timewasting fillings. It is like first 'story' (two first seasons) HAD to have nearly 20 episodes rather than make a proper cutting. Make a new cutting and reduce to 5-6 episodes. Then it would be an intense thriller. Now it was more like 'when is something going to happen'.	0
1	May be a 7.2.. Dumb and Dumber	People complaint about the seasons 3 and 4 (which i never watched ) but i found nothing special with even the first 2 seasons The robbers were dumb , the professor was dumb to have a relationship with the inspector and how the hell was their asses saved?...coz the police were dumber .	0
9	Wasting time	Nice idea for a movie not a series , making too much time for extending their episodes, some Spanish amateurs actors with many non professional directing , could be much more better than that with more working , some how enjoyed some episodes of first part , and second part still watching some episodes good some not , great idea of act but poor making it sad for that 😣😔	1
1	From stars to mud	Season 1 and 2 amazing, unexpected events with a twist of ibteresting plots and subjects, season 3 good intro into the heist remake of season 1, season 4 total rip off from the series, just happens to be the best assassin in spain, and gets shot couple of times doesnt die, kills nairobi and still nobody shoots him, from s4 e4 just a stupid drama series, even a 15-year old would make a better plot twist than this, cant believe, not even worth watching s5, cause in the end theyre gonna escape... regret watching it	0
3	It's a rocket at beginning but crashes fast	Plot starts out great ingenious. But quickly fizzles episode by episode. Turns into long drawn out boring soap opera. Overloaded by testosterone and estrogen in typical soapy European fashion. Too many pretty young actors portraying hardened criminals but look more like yuppie espresso sipping umbrella cafe patrons. The actors that pretend to look like real hardened criminals are over the top. Mohawks and such. Right. Thumbs up to Madridywood and Netflix for trying to make a suspenseful, intelligent, crime thriller. But this one is a long watch and doesn't pay off.	0
1	My god this is so bad and annoying.	"I had to write another review.

This is insulting writing. / plot."	0
4	Nice idea, bad development	Rating certainly not 8,5. It had potential, great plot, bad development. Unnecessary seasons. Tokyo's acting cringe af.	0
4	After the first 2 great seasons it became boring...	We loved the first 2 seasons. Season 3 was OK. We stopped watching after a few episodes of season 4, slow, unlikely and boring.	0
10	Solid 10!!!!...Best Heist story i've ever watched	"Amazing series...perfection in every episode...watched it till episode ""Bella Ciao""...for me it was the best ending....gonna watch additional episode netflix produced."	1
10	MASTERPIECE!	I have never reviewed any movie or series but with this one, I had to. This series is a masterpiece! Congratulations to Spain for delivering such an epic series, congratulations to Álex Pina for such mastermind behind all this, and congratulations to the actors, because of them I have laughed and cried. For those who don't know if they should watch, please do, you will go for the ride of your life! BELLA CIAO, professor!	1
3	Season 3 was a bad idea	It used to be great, now it is just a sad story. And the story isn't even finished.	0
8	Brilliant thriller	A great story well told . Everything about this series is faultless . Acting , direction , plot , thrills . I finished Season 1 last night and can't wait for Season 2	1
9	Best show in a long time	Smart, original, suspenseful... the list goes on. Hooked me at the very beginning and kept me wanting more throughout the whole season. The whole idea is just great; 13 episodes, one heist. Highly recommend it.	1
3	What!?!	How can this be rated so high! I sat through the entire 1st season hoping for something, anything good to come from this. It's awful. It is so fake, cheesy, and the plot is just dumb. The acting, dialogue, I just can't say how bad it is. Save yourself the disappointment and just watch Oceans 11.	0
9	Better then much other series	Better then much other series I hope this series will be continued..	1
1	The series would be cool without the girl from Tokyo.	The girl Tokyo can not follow the plan, I want to jump scenes with this character.	0
3	A heist that robs itself of standards	When I was a child, the first books of Harry Potter were published; I remember enjoying the first book, but by the time I read the fourth book, the story had faded away into lifelessness. Not only had the script already been stretched too far, the writer, hungry for money and popularity, depraved herself of moral standards and produced 3 more toilet paper books. These have faded away forever from the memories of our civilisation and the characters now burn in the timeless incarceration of literary hell. This is the story of La Casa de Papel.	0
4	Overrated.	"The concept is nice. The plot gets well established during the first episodes with planning, character introduction and rules.

My main issue is the bad writing overall. Meaning that the execution of the plot is a mess. The characters force themselves into the silliest situations. Usually this can be ignored, but it happens too often. The expectations I had got ripped after watching ep 4. and the serie went onto more important things like, pregnancy, divorce, strong women, evil men etc. You know, Netflix enforcing their political view."	0
3	Worse than the original.....	What a Hype! And then this....unreliable story board, bad actors (Raquel), clumsy realization. Sorry guys, not what I expected after all this fancy Reviews. Inside Man remains my first choice.	0
8	Season 2 should have been the last season	This is what happens when netflixnbuys a shoe jist to make money. So stupid.	1
3	it sucks	"It sucks. everything they use is a played out trope. i wish i could say more, but every plot element is just so shoddily placed like a ""love conflict"" does nothing to spice up the plot. definitely for the novela fans. certainly nothing to appreciate artistically."	0
10	If you like Prison Break you may like this	Every episode will make you want to see more. Amazing mind blowing masterpiece. Is like a mix between Death Note with a Heist. I don't know what is wrong with the people hating it or saying that the reviews are fake or paid. If you hate this is probably because you don't like hearing spanish actors (or you are a racist). Spanish is my first language so this was natural to me, I was concentrated on the amazing actors and story (and i don't normally watch Spanish TV shows). Give it a try you won't regret it.	1
9	Season 2 Brilliant	More of the same on season 2 of this excellent Spanish film series, Just binge watched on Netflix,, it seems Netflix seem to do foreign language shows a lot better than the American or English made shows, none stand out when compared to mainland European, why this is, well I think there's just better talent outside the mainstream it tells its own story when all I can watch on Netflix is subtitled, oh ya money heist is excellent, if u seen season 1 u won't need me to tell u how good it is	1
8	masterpiece	Loved the acting, sound tracks and of course the suspence.	1
4	A letdown	Such a shame, close to being really good. Great idea, soooo many technical inaccuracies that even a child would notice. Are all of these positive reviews by the same person, all very similarly written. Sad. Oh well, some you win.	0
10	Absolutely amazing!	This series keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times. Great amount of action and meaningful messages along the way! Highly recommend it :)	1
3	Spoiled	The netflix autoplay trailer SPOILED the 1st season! Come on Netflix.	0
10	Good Job Netflix	This is the best, I like everything.But I wait for part. 4 to end this.NO SPOILERS	1
10	A MASTERPIECE	The best series I have ever watched. All the actors rock 😍 Can't wait for the next seasonnnn!!!	1
10	Awesome	This is the best series I have seen awesome story good twist and turns,the professor was really smart you sort of routing for him	1
10	OMG 🔛	The third season is so greatful. I have never seen a movie like this. I dont have words to explain how excited i'm feeling right now 🔝🔝	1
1	It gets worse and worse by the episode (hard to watch)	It is like dump and dumper are off to make a heist. I started with two stars when i was in he end of season 1 now having watched it i reduced it to one. Too many holes in script, unreasonable actions from the caracters and at some points it is more funny than dramatic.	0
10	Perfect for people who don't like super long series	This series will stay on my mind for a long time! I couldn't stop watching it. 3 or more episodes per day! Respect!	1
1	not realistic	This film isn't match the real european law. and cops are really idiot, foolish and coward they are really weakness about solving case or any problem. And a detective woman is most idiot and fool also. we seen in every movie, woman police officer (detective, comissioner)and man police officer are arguing. so this is not quitely different and incisive movie.	0
10	Mi casa es su casa	The plot could not be better. El profesor is the key of success in this serie. In addition, all characters were well developed through each episode. It is almost impossible to stop watching. Plot twists are frequently as important and real-life questions raised especially in last chapters. Definitely worth re-watching.	1
1	No spoilers but Part 5 was absolute rubbish.	"Well what a let down .. first 3 seasons were good... after that it just went downhill. And Part 5 was painful to watch to be honest.

And if you watch the behind the scenes episode after it all finished in Part 5 All the actors and actresses did was complain .. complain... complain about the scenes, the dust,they were tired.., Talk about a bunch of amateur divas."	0
1	God awful after season 1.5	"Somewhere around halfway through season 2 very little takes place in the present. They're either going back to the glory days of planning or going back to show how brilliantly they saw the future. Then the political correctness thrown in and the portrayal of bank robbers as victims. This is one for the masses who play lotto, and like in the last episode I could stand to watch, would fight for ""free"" money dropped from the sky."	0
4	The whole season 4 is a waste of time	"Can it get any worst than this

Stay tuned for season 5"	0
2	Waste of my time	First three episodes had me interested. Then I began growing tired of the flashbacks and character development. By the end of Part 1 after FF through much of it, I watched a few episodes of Part 2 and once again couldn't take the slow pace, so right to the last 40 minutes I went. What an ending! I must tell others - do not waste your time.	0
9	Best so far	Can't wait for season 4. Simply amazing. It gets better by the season.	1
10	Such a great and addicting series!!!	This show is absolutely one of my favorites! With the suspense and twists through the series, all the characters are unique and you have love for them all in a different way. The show has a berry good direction and I hope it continues to succeed for years to come!!	1
10	The best of the best in Netflix	This is one show which got me hooked from the very first episode until the last one. Couldn't stop in between. The storyline is very tight and gripping and the actors have paid their roles to perfection. Eagerly waiting for the 3rd season.	1
10	Kudos to casts and crews	Great character building. Original storyline and logical. Each of them are very well introduced without flaws and they compliment each other as a team. Every episode had such a wonderful balance, you can't predict their next moves. Well, im a big fan of spanish tv show now. Cant wait for the next season! Bella ciao	1
10	You can't stop the binge	I won't give anything away but this is one to watch I binged the entire two seasons in a week each episode is better than the last my only tiny gripe is the English audio dubbed over the top but after a few episodes in you don't notice I can't wait for season 3	1
8	Sit back and enjoy the ride	I loved this series and watched over a couple days. Don't take too serious and you will find an exciting and original series. Only complaint for me was the English dubbing. wrong voices for most of characters and was pretty annoying. Would prefer to see the original with English sub-titles.	1
9	A series for thriller and mind games lovers!	I must say la casa de papel is an original series with great mind game ideas that will keep you hooked in all the episodes the ideas of the robbery plan are original and fresh.in my opinion it will be better if the producers worked more on the guns aspect, in some scenes we see robbers or police shooting from guns more then 200+ bullets without even reloading which clearly make no sense even for non guns experts. other then that it's a great series.	1
10	Worth every minute !	By far one of the best show I have watched. I don't usually like foreign movies because the traduction is bad, but the actors are wonderful and the characters are wonderful. You root for them as the heist goes along, and definitely keeps you on the edge. It is more than just criminals, there is values, rules, morals and definitely sends a bigger message about who the real crooks are in the world.	1
10	Amazing	This is simply one of the best shows I have ever watched in this genre. Must see!	1
10	Incrível....	Melhor impossível. Adorei tudo! Show.... Demais. Massa. Top. Único.	1
10	Amazing!	The group of a actors is just amazing! Berlín makes me hate and love him at the same time, Nairobi makes me feel empowered, and Arturo makes me angry. I cried, laughed, celebrated, and cursed with them! Would highly reccomend. Addictive and binge-wortht.	1
1	🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸,🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸	🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸You have to apologize.	0
1	Fk la casa and fk Israel	Fk la casa and fk Israel. Fk la casa and fk Israel.	0
4	They overdid it after season 2	A pregnant lady beats 3 men, seriously. We don't want to know about Tokyo's love life... More you watch it... More stupid it gets.	0
9	The best heist so far	The series is just awesome. One cannot predict anything that what is coming next. The script writing is so strong and acting skills is just awesome. The heist which shows in this series was so engaging that one can complete all the four season in just 4 days or even lesser. I recommend this series to every one who want to watch some awesome and unpredictable heist. WIATING FOR SEASON 5 SINCE LAST YEAR.	1
3	Trash	I don't understand the hype...this is a soap opera, the characters are bad and the story makes zero sense.	0
1	Paper !	Really this series was a total mess No story no form no drama Just a foolish joke with all the history of Cinema Very poor characteristics , directing movie full of bugs Nothing to say	0
9	Beyond expectations	Before watching it I heard many times people talking about it and I gave it a try. Damnn it's one of the best web series I ever watched. However breaking bad is always No.1 in my list.	1
10	One of the best series i have ever seen	Its Very nice and creativity season 1,2,3 and 4 was very good , some people seen that should finish in season 2 but this serie is Incredible ! If this serie was American it's was taken an a 9/10 but because it spinch it take a low rate	1
1	Don't waste your time with season 2	Season 1 was good and we had a nice time. Season 2 script was apparently written solely on the basis of the first seasons success. The nonsense in it is unbearable. Half of the events are idiotic. Nowhere close to season 1. Such a waste of time.	0
2	Horrible.	As professor rightly said in 7th episode of season 4. Please keep your sense aside. That's the whole concept of money heist. They have been digging tunnels again all around. Very hard to believe how can someone like this kinda web series.	0
1	pathetic. slow. boring. dramatic.	Ok. First of all it's very slow and unrealistic. It gets boring over time due to dramatic personal experiences. Why they have directed season 3 and 4 God knows.	0
2	leftie series	First season was okay.. then they started to play some communism music etc.. beside it's not even realistic like how can Spanish police be so dumb and not be able to arrest 8 hippies	0
1	Overrated	Overrated.. don't just go with ratings. Bunch of thieves can't keep it together to get the job done!.... Big robbery	0
1	Crime drama wanna be!	I am surprised to see that people are not happy with season 4. I've just forced myself to finish the first season and I have one question, could it get any worse?! Low quality drama with hundreds of mistakes and stupid characters. I can write pages criticizing every aspect of this show, but I'll sum up by saying, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!	0
3	Let's all fall in love	I shut it off after three episodes. Right after the robbers and hostages started falling in love after one day!! Got comical actually. No thanks. Horrible script. I want those hours back. Grossly overrated.	0
2	Extremely Weak And Overrated!	"Disinteresting, shoddily written, mild sexist, overrated.

Started this on Netflix because my friends told me it's a great watch and the IMDB rating were great too. Unfortunately, it is darn boring. I might have a different taste when it comes to the heist genre. I expect the thieves to be smarter people who can outwit the police but what we see here is a bunch of people making stupid errors one after the other."	0
2	Season 1&2 is good, but..	Season 3 is pure crap, even though it is entertaining sometimes it is ruined,	0
9	Sleepless night passed	"Just came across the name of this series when I asked my cousins to give me few names for my eyes and brains to see and think.

It started slowly and accelerated like G_force that I continued seeing it for a whole night at a stretch, always thinking and trying to guess the twist. But in vein till the very end.

Acting was awesome specially by the professor and the berlin.

Over all very pleased, waiting for another name."	1
3	Weak	Good idea but completely fails at execution. The script is flawed and completely unrealistic. If one is to believe the Spanish police doesn't have a clue how to shoot...	0
2	Completely senseless	The worst serial ever.The serial has a plot for around 10 episodes which has completely been stretched out. As the show progresses, it becomes more illogical. Complete waste of your time. Do not believe the ratings.	0
4	Could have been, but wasn't	Had nearly everything to be a top class show, but fails horribly in the details. Plot is twisted and retwisted beyond any credibility. Cops are just shown as a band of morons, affairs between hijackers and hostages are quite ridiculous (as is also the affair between the professor and ladycop). But, above all that, the girl who plays Tokyo is absolutely insulting. Her acting is soooo bad I ended up fast forwarding when sh was on screen. it is really insulting.	0
10	Just brilliant......	Script - 10/10 Direction - 10/10 Acting - 10/10 Been a while since I have seen a story so gripping.... i think the last was Breaking Bad that got me hooked. Amazing cast and superior screenplay/direction. after seeing this, i HAVE TO learn espanyol :-)	1
10	Outstanding	This series is one of the best series I've ever seen, the script and the acting was incredible.	1

1	SHAME!! Being Pro-Israel = being Pro-ethnic cleansing	Was disappointed to have known that the cast is pro-Israel. This means that they support an apartheid regime that kills Palestinian people including children then withhold some of their corpses to use them as a bargaining chips, illegally colonises and displaces Palestinians' lands, and bombs Gaza when they have some free time in their hands!! SHAME!!	0
1	Supports ethnic cleansing	"It supports ethnic cleansing and zionist crimes.

8	My kind of crazy	Seeing many of the negative reviews. I think people need to lighten up. Yes the show is crazy, ridiculous even but it's a load of fun. It's not a show that takes itself seriously. It wears its heart on its sleeve, has tons of ideas and energy. This is a cast and crew having loads of fun making this show and that's infectious to watch. Yes it's a soap opera in a way, but no more so than all those highly rated seasons of 24. People need to get over themselves getting so upset about it.	1
1	Unacceptable	Actors with Israel🤢 and this is unacceptable. This is means that they are with killing people and kids in Palestine 🇵🇸 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸 Free Palestine🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸And there is no Israel.	0
8	Diffrence in seasons quality	Two first seasons are 9/10, 3rd one is 7/10 and 4th one is 4/10, I know on avarege it doesnt give 8/10 but i usually take the better seasons more into account then the bad ones when giving a review to a tv show.	1
8	I have no headline for thise	The 2nd and the 3rd season were perfect but It should have ended in season two . Seasons 3 and 4 seem to be extra . If there were only 2 season , that could have much more rating . Season 3and 4 deserve 5or6 rating . If i go back in time , I'll only watch the first two seasons .so I'll have a good memory in my mind .	1
4	I bet most of the Reviews Comes from a Less expectation crowd. Who watched FRIENDS all their life and act Like them in real Life	"I would not say its the Worst show Ever, however not that great show for the Hype. I am sure Most of the positive Reviews are from Countries Like India or other South east Asian Countries who basically look for the ""Cool"" Aspect in a show and are new to watching Well scripted TV series... But trust me there are genuinely Well scripted Series out there worth your Time..."	0
9	Best Series when it comes to surprise.	Those who said that series should be end after season 2. I am totally disagree with that Season 3 , 4 have too much fun , surprise than initial 2. Must watch series . My favourite character is Professor 😁 .	1
10	Way too amazing	Awesome 😎👍😎😎 webseries. You need to watch it. The Professor and Berlin give me chills.	1
10	Best web series I have ever seen	"They say don't judge the book by its cover, but I did this mistake when I swa the image of this series and the title never attracted me to watch it till now but one of my friends praised it so much I gave it a try and I finished all 4 parts in 4 days, now I am not able to resist myself to watch it again, I loved it so much, Professsor, Tokyo, Rio, Denver, Lisbon, Niraobi, Hensikee are my so damn favourite. What we will do post 5th season,gonna miss it like anything.

Love from India."	1
10	One of the Best TV show i have ever watched	"Very long show They don't even completed the second season in. Part

I love heist movies and I just found this one in Netflix and I literally couldn't stop watching through the night. The characters are simply amazing! Don't miss this!	1
9	One of the greatest action drama masterpiece.	The makers of the show has done an brilliant job which is clearly evident from the popularity of the show. It is a must watch tv show. I think money heist should be in the top 10 most rated movies. The show has undoubtedly has glamorous action.	1

10	money heist	One of my most favorite web series is the web series. Thanks for giving Berlin and the whole team such a good web show.	1
8	One of my Favs	The reason why I gave it an 8 is because the low reviews are right, it should have ended before I feel like it would've been a legendary show if it had ended after season 2. Other than that its really worth the watch and I don't understand why people didn't like it its really good from intro to end and the intensity stays at the top	1
10	Great story	I love how Netflix is picking up international films and translating the dialogue	1
10	The best tv show	If you start watching this show. I bet you will watch full a complete season without break. The suspense, thrilling, nice plotting is all in this show The La Casa De Papel	1
9	Good show	Very interesting show. All characters are very good personally my favourite is Berlin	1
10	Never ever seen these type of web series or movie.	Continue watched seasen 1 and now all season has been watched. I have never ever seen these type of web series or movie.

10	I'm waiting for season five Great series.Great series.	A very great series I'm waiting for season five I love Tokyo Director, don't let Tokyo die	1
10	A Great Thriller of 21st century	It surpass every series since 2000. Usually Hollywood take lead but here a Spanish series took over	1
4	Overrated AF	A soap opera with guns. Nothing special at all. I can honestly see why it failed when it was originaly aired on spanish television. Netflix really performed a miracle here.	0
10	Best heist series, must watch!!!	If you have watched till s3 and you had loved the characters then s4 will be the best for you..	1
10	Absolutely brilliant!!	This series has everything what you need but why the dubbing cast changed after second season!? Watching start of season 3rd was completely boring, these voices are not even near to the original one!	1
10	Bella Ciao	Can't say enough for Money Heist, its a phenomenon. If you miss it, its your loss.	1
10	Love love love !!!	This was a funny kind of series that sucked me in- it's a love story really- not so serious as in- believable - just fun ! The characters are endearing and everyone around me -> we couldn't get enough !! Hope there are more seasons !!	1
1	Horrible	"Of course it's horrible.
This show it's 8.4, which means it's
overhyped.
Illogical acting, just a lot of melodrama.
One of the most characters I hate in this
show is Denver.
Why this show is just represented only in
Royal Mint and why they don't run and fight hard against cops.
Really it's not the 3rd and 4th season
ruined this show, but all the episodes starting from the 2nd episode season 1.

Sorry don't consider my rating as a 1/10, beacause it's 0/10."	0
9	High Octane Action-Packed Banger From Netflix	One of the best non-English series on Netflix in the past decade. All charecters are well written. Production value is very good. Beautiful sets and VFX shots are used. Locations are good. Very high on adrenaline. The writing is unapologetic. The writers spare no one. Finally, the actors have done a tremendous job (especially Ursula,Alvaro and pedro)	1
10	Woooooooooooo!!!!!!	Amaaaaaaaazing!!!! I can't belive it! just WOW!!! I never seen movie like this!	1
10	the best series for ever	I really love that. so attractive drama, fun, mysterious and full of melancholy	1
3	If you think this is good then i guess you don't watch a lot of heist shows/movies	"This show is plain DUMB. It is full of plotholes and stupid dialogues. Characters are annoying and utterly unprofessional. Their master is one of those i-knew-it-already and you-fell-into-my-trap whenever something goes wrong. The story is one of those StreetSide cheap novels where police is always dumb.

Go watch prison break and maybe you can see the difference between a dumb show and a good heist show."	0
9	Worth it!	Seasons 1 and 2 are really good. In fact, one of Netflix's top jobs. The third season still carries the strength of the recurring characters, as well as introducing Inspector Sierra as a novelty, the debate about the unofficial torture of the State and Helsinki and Nairobi gain more space (showing themselves to be very strong characters). Season 4 (2020) prolongs what should have ended with a longing goodbye.	1
10	A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.	"Call it communist, call it propaganda but this series delivers a heist we've all longed for.

All characters are memorable and the heist feels real. The screenplay is bang on and unfolds each step slow and steady. You wont skip a second.

This heist has everything: a legit and believable plan, a legit motive and the Mastermind we never knew we needed .. Professor!

Looking forward to season 5!"	1
10	"esta obra maestra ""la casa de papel"" no necesita un titular"	"This series touched my heart💕.... N it's difficult to express how I feel in words. It's just a""obra de arte"""	1
10	Binge material!	Just watched first two seasons, can't believe how addicting this show is. I'm just about to binge the rest. Viva Alex Pina!	1
10	FAVORITE	Everything Alex Pina does is just so good that I ended up googling all his work so I can watch everything :) This show is amazing ofc didn't even have a doubt. Makes you binge all day long till you finish all the seasons.	1
10	Te mantendrá siempre en suspenso!	LO MEJOR QUE TIENE NETFLIX HASTA EL MOMENTO, SOBRE TODO LA ACTUACIÓN MUY BUENA Y MUY BIEN PENSADO EL DESARROLLO	1
9	Waiting for season 5	Liked the web series. watched all four seasons. My favourite character is the professor, such an intelligent character. Now waiting to see how they will get out from the bank.	1
10	Great!	I really like this series and I think it is a great idea It has a very interesting story thats gets better with the good acting of the actors in the film.	1
10	One of the best series	I watched this series until season 4 in 2 weeks on Netflix. I must say that Money Heist left me think twice for my flavor of shows on Netflix. This is the best one I have ever watched. If you didn't watched this one, it's meaningless to use Netflix.	1
9	Outstanding	Excellent web series. Professor & Berlin outstanding. Love from Bangladesh.	1
8	Narration	I hate Tokyo and Rio. Most annoying characters. Don't understand why they picked Tokyo as the narrator. Should've chose the Professor as the narrator.	1
9	Best heist series I have watched	Two seasons for Mint of Spain and two for Bank of Spain. The characterization of the professor was excellent. Very intelligent. First two season were excellent and remaining two could have been better but the twist at the end of season 4 is good. Eagerly waiting for season 5.	1
9	Relaxing one	Enjoyable unique series. The acting is great and have binged watch all the 4 seasons within 4 days.	1
9	Incredible	This is 100% the best Netflixseries i've watched so far! The actors are amazing and the storyline is insane. It also made me cry several times and I just CAN'T wait for part 5 :)	1
10	I loved it. <3	The best series of all times. The characters, the plot, the cinematography , everything is amazing.	1
8	And this is how TV should be	"Suspenseful, funny, and action packed. ""Money Heist"" (La Casa De Papel) is a feast for the eyes and the senses. The cast is so well put together and the storyline keeps you on the edge of your seat."	1
9	One of the best series ever	Favorite series after game of thrones.all the character of money heist is very good and one of the best characters in money heist are professor and tokyo.i think all the people should watch this series	1
10	One of the best series!!	No words for this amazing series! This has been the best series I've seen so far. The casting, story line, acting, everything is just perfect like how the way it should be! People who mostly binge watch thriller series, I strongly recommend you to go and watch this and I guarantee you that the suspense created at every end of the episode will not stop you to watch the next episode.	1
10	One of the best series so far.	I think this was one of the best series i have seen so far. Didn't like Nairobi death though. All characters were amazing.	1
10	Wow, edge of the seat chess game!	"If you enjoy bank robberies and the cat and mouse concept with brilliant story writing, this show is for you. I pulled three all-nighters as I couldn't wait to see whose game is ahead more turns (robbers vs cops).

Excellent all around! Made me cry and had my heart beating like crazy!

Can't wait for Season 5!!"	1
10	Good but ...	Great show but in the English version the voice over is very off key but other than that the show is very good and u get very engaged in to it	1
9	Berlin is lob	I just write this review in the favour of character Berlin. They way he talk and the expression he beautifully delivered is just outstanding. Professor is also to good but Berlin is the best. I watched this in a single go on two days and whole four seasons get completed. The story is good as plan is beautiful planned by the professor and the situation is always making suspense everytime.	1
9	La Casa de Papel	Many people criticize the love drama inside, but in fact, the core of the crime drama is love drama. Love drama enriches every role, making them become flesh and blood rather than symbolic robbers, so we will stand in their position just like the people in the drama.	1
10	Perfect series.	What a series. Perfectly directed and perfectly executed by the actors. Full of action and romance. Really enjoyed. Awaiting next episode. Hope they release soon.	1
10	One of the best series	Its one of the best series I've ever seen. But i feel the story was just perfect and completed in season 2	1
1	Piece of unintelligent crap	What a waste of time and piece of crap, nothing makes sense... The professor is showcased as all knowing, all might God who has a solution for everything, does karate chops and beat up trained cops like flies.. I want my time back	0
10	Great in all ways!	"Honestly, I have never been so addicted to a TV show like this one! From the beginning to the great finale in season 2! And then? Season three and four all the time it is only ""up and down like a rollercaster"" you never know what is coming! Can't understand how can anoyone be upset about it?!"	1
1	Pathetic, a waste of time.	Lousy script, lousy actors, a mediocre serie that became trendy thanks to a very undemanding audience.	0
10	Characters over the plot	Most of us might say season 3 & 4 is a waste of time but imho, this series managed to enter into people's minds & hearts with their meticulously crafted characters & unexpected moves & plots by the professor. Season 4 could've been better but still it manages to keep the adrenaline rush... I'd love to see them in the coming years as well....	1
10	One word	"BRILLIANCE, Not only the show has a solid story line but also perfection in execution. It's not one of the show you see and forget about! It shows how imperfect can a perfect plan be. The show connects with emotions and mend them in its favor... Again: BRILLIANCE.

This is my first 10 out of 10 show, not even Game of Thrones or Vikings or Breaking Bad passed this threshold for me!"	1
9	Specutalar... marvellous.... superb	What a show !!!! What a show !!!! Just loved every piece of it !!!! A great Storytelling.... editing... direction...bgm and superb soundtrack	1
10	Love everything about this show	This show is amazing. The characters, the plot, the antagonists, the plot twists and turns, everything about this show is perfect. Every season has been spectacular and this is currently my favorite show. I would recommend this to everyone.	1
10	Time is money	Season 1 and 2 were great and amazing, I'd say 9/10. But then Netflix saw a chance to make money and prolongued this show into 2 unnecessary seasons that completely ruined this show. I'm just sick and tired of this by Netflix. This last season was a disaster, filled with unrealistic stuff. Stop before it's too late.	1
8	I've only watched the first 2 seasons	"I'm giving an 8/10 for the first 2 seasons and have decided not to watch the remaining ones after reading all the comments about how it got a lot worse.

The first 2 seasons were epic. A must-watch series."	1
3	Slowly Fading	"First season was really something... Unusual, fresh, modern, unpredictable and cool, i couldn't wait until next episode. Unfortunately after the first season Casa de Papel has turned into a classic spanish novella. It went from ""crime/ thriller"" to ""drama/ romance"", Lots of soap opera twists, lots of crying and stupid unnecessary moves. Just classic spanish drama where it all ends with ""Casandra your aunt is your mother, and your boyfriend is your brother"" .... totally predictable and not interesting, Please give us back the old Casa de Papel."	0
9	Incredible !	"This is the best Spanish show ! Great acting , has action , has suspense , has emotions and has many twists until season 4 came out

Season 1 : 10/10 Season 2 : 9/10 Season 3 : 8/10 Season 4 : 6/10"	1
10	Best series 👌	Loved the concept and writing. The best watched till date a big fan of professor.	1
3	Utter twaddle.	What the ruddy f is this bunch of arse about? Godawful dries.	0
8	Seasons 3 and 4 f+cked it up.	See the reviews of other users - almost everyone is saying that it should have ended at season 2 and there was literally no need of unnecessary lame sequels, especially when season 2 had the perfect climax. 8 stars are for seasons 1 and 2 2 stars for season 3 and 4.	1
10	Request for dubbing	In India there is a huge fan base of webseries of Netflix Amazon Prime hbo and many more plzz dubb this series money hiest in hindi also	1
1	Bad writing	Very very very bad writing. How could you ever write this scene?? Referring to episode 6 of season 4. Immidiately stopped watching the show. Words cannot describe the feeling. Did not deserve this. Shame on you.	0
10	***One of the best shows I have watched so far***	"A big big round of applause to the maker of this show ""Álex Pina"" and the entire cast. Extraterrestrial script, awesome direction, excellent acting by the cast and last but not the least, the theme song ' Bella Ciao"" .This is one of the best shows I have seen so far. I wish few characters were not dead such as Moscow and Nairobi (my favourite characters). There is one character I hated the most which is undoubtedly ""Arturo"". This also means the actor justified the negative role.

Gracias por crear este show.

4	Overhyped piece of s**t!!!	It was good till season 1. As they said the plan was a masterpiece and 100% full proof. But very soon you will realize that the character are saying so just for the sake of it. No plan could ever be full proof and you will begin to notice the flaws. Even then it was good till season 2. But then enters Netflix, to cash in the good work done in first two seasons. Season 3 & 4 are just lame. Netflix completely ruined it.	0
1	Season 4 has been a complete waste	Not worth for such a high rating. Can watch the first two season barring a few flaws. Avoid the rest as it goes downhill with absurd plotline and debased characters	0
1	1 star for 4th season.	This show is got bad from 4th season. especially 3rd and 4th season.	0
1	part 4	The fourth part is not worthy of the final in the series, it is a disappointment	0
1	Cliché	The first season isn't even good enough to be watched outside. Why is there a Turkish character that looks like an Arab? what's the point here? What does he contribute to you and the script?	0
2	Booooring	Boooring! Though the story is quite different and intersting but....the screenplay is slow and sleepy.It is just another stupid overrated show on netflix	0
10	Incredible!	One of the best Neflix series I have ever seen. An amazing story with twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Incredible character development and the acting is top notch! You will gasp, laugh, cry and fall in love!	1
10	Oh My God	It is the best series i have ever watched. The professor played his role so perfectly that i am amazed and not to forget BERLIN what a brilliant actor he is. And the story plot just wow. Everyone justified their role so perfectly that not a single flaw in series. Eagerly waiting for season 4.	1
10	Nice! Series with Gripping Characters	This series is very fast paced from the start. Slows down a bit throughout the middle of the first series but allows you to learn more about each character. The backstories and bond between the characters is what makes you keep watching.	1
10	One of the best series that I had watched till date!	"Lacasa De Papel (Money Heist)

One of the best series that I had watched till date!

Their screenplay and character development are so much impressive!!!

Part 1 was eye opening. Part 2 was ice breaker. Part 3 was the reckoning!!!

Part 4 is coming in April 2020!!!

Currently available in Netflix."	1
10	...	Incredible direction and story makes it special. If you haven't seen that yet, you may have lost many many things.	1

10	best series	Best series better than game of thrones(just because of season8) the last ep was better than ned stark execution	1
10	One of the best series I watched	Lately I was thinking to watch some different genre of series, where I found this series. Just gave it a start, believe the screenplay and the story is so gripping I was watching continuously till season 2. I really recommend this series for who are craving for thrilling heist experience.	1
10	Be blessed	The world is approximately 4.543 billion years and we should be blessed to be alive when Money Heist was created. Finally I've watched something to get rid of Game of Thrones disappointment.	1
10	One of the best series's I have watched!	"Acting is on the highest level! Every character is well developed, you feel character's emotions and what they are going through. There is lots of action going on, making audience almost ""addicted"" to the show. Love it! 10/10"	1
10	Seen it twice already.	Super good series, with a lot of excitement an never boring. Men and women will love this! Again a super good Spanish series after seen the extreme good series Gran Hotel, Velvet and Vis a Vis.	1
10	I can't say with my words	Superb, marvellous, interesting......etc , I told you one think you can't stop this series.. after seeing one episode..!!!	1
10	Great!	Woderful, Great, Unbelievable, Excellent, The best ever, Mind blowing	1
4	Watch the original language version. Dubbed is awful	Dubbed makes all of the characters idiotic. Original language is much better	0
10	Amazing, best tv show I've seen	Speechless cliffhanger endings to each episode but the part 3 finale was amazing that made part 3 of money heist just amazing the way everything is played out all throughout the show from part 1 to part 3 is so smart and amazing. Overall great show	1
10	Just Amazing	The story keeps you holding it is written and directed so well that you will fall in love with the series season 3 end is just the best hoping the next season i.e part 4 to be upto the mark	1
2	why	"The show and the idea in itself is very good.

but there are to many impasient and short sighted characters, and a little over the top drama.

could have been an amazing show."	0
10	One of my favorite show.	"The reason why i really liked this show it was because i could relate easily to the characters.

Especially Berlin.I could relate to him in so many occasions and that made the show 1000 times better.

The characters are interesting,original and not annoying.

The plot is beyond amazing.It's extremely well written with many thoughts and hidden insights.

The overall atmosphere is incredible with good color grading and good camera angles

I recommend this show without hesitation.

10/10

Summary

etc,

Other than that this show is a solid 10/10"	1
10	La Casa De Papel:Money Heist - Best series i have ever seen	Most wonderful, uunpredictable, well acted tv series i have ever had the pleasure of watching. Fantastically acted and brilliantly scripted. Watch in Spanish with subtitles, doesnt work for me dubbed. More please, ;)	1
10	Beste Serie!!!	Eine der besten Serien die ich je gesehen habe... sehr sehr spannend. ;)	1
10	The people Who vote less of 6 is hater of Spanish serie	This serie os awesome , always the americans try to belittle the work of other countries . Is DISGUSTING ALL THE PEOPLE WHO VOTE 2 OR 1 OR 3 DISGUSTING!!!!	1
2	Perhaps ...	... you should engage your critical and objective viewpoints regarding this over-blown series. It's easy to fall into the trap of it being a 'robin hood' type movie and maybe that was the intention of the writers. But it fails because the plot lines are ludicrous, it's full of holes, the acting is one-dimensional and, worst of all, one can't feel empathy, or even care, what happens to the characters.	0
1	SHAME ON YOU	Kids in Palestine are Dyiing And still ur actors support Isre*l Shame.	0
1	Free palastain	You support the killer!!!! Palestine will always be free 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸, you have to change the theme of the series and show your true face as a killer supporter. As Palestinians, we will not accept your support for crime criminals . Free palastain.	0

1	When you want libration from the banks system, you can not support occupation in any way!	"FREE PALESTINE.

When you want libration from the banks system, you can not support occupation in any way!"	0
1	Free palestine	Although the series is against global financial injustice, the actors of this series appeared in an Israeli interview and supported the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories. Shame on you.	0
1	Palestine	I used to like this show and the characters. Unfortunately supporting the children killing and houses bombing is not part of the humanity. Such a shame.	0
10	Can I give extra 1 point and make it 11 ?	"2021 was running dry of good movies and series. Just 2 or 3 good movies and series created a Tsunami.

Oh Tokyo I love you 😊.

Last episode felt like you are shivering, tense, muscles and lips locked... Doses of 5 episodes was a smart and effective move.

Every Character are played so well by everyone. We Miss Berlin in the Museum though."	1
10	Boomblastic ....😍😍	One if the bestest series ever made...it's like addiction...you just can't leave for a sec or u'll miss something for sure...brilliant performance by everyone...fantastic direction and story line...the plot ...the twist...the music...the emotions..wht to say...just amazing... Loved it and will be watched again and again and again over the coming years . . Bela Ciao...	1
10	Top	I guess people who give bad reviewers about this series needs to love their life a little more.. this series is a masterpiece in all aspects catch you from scene one once you start you just cant stop.	1
10	Amazing 😀	I don't understand why people hate this series Just watch amazing.	1
3	Top 5 worst tv show	A show with too many goofy scenes we dont even know its a drama love trash show or heist.	0
10	Best thriller serie like Prison Break	We see a mastermind person that faces tremendous challenges.	1
2	Overrated	It may be the most overrated tv series in the world	0
2	Stupid	This series is pretty stupid. A lot of things don't make sense and also the characters are bad, they always make bad decision just to keep the story going. The first two part are full of problems but they are watchable I would have given 6 stars probably, but the third and fourth part deserve 0.	0
10	Masterpice	This web series awesome very mastermind professor Moeny heist. Very good webserise	1
10	BEST SHOW EVER	This is arguably my favourite show on netflix! i have got my whole family watching it!! all of the actors are so incredible and the english dubbing is spot on! great soundtrack in seasons 3-4 as well! looking forward to stage 5th season coming out in april!!! bella ciao !	1
1	Mediocre soap opera	The first two season were watchable but the soap opera element was too present. The third and fourth season are garbage.	0
10	The Best show for INDIAN AUDIENCE	"Just go for it.

The show is slow poison once you start it just go for it and try to binge watch it .

A season at one go and you will not regret it for sure."	1
10	Wow! It's awesome!	Addicted to watch this great series! Maybe the management can still possibly give a shot for Alba Flores(Nairobi) to play a character as a missing twin sister. 🤔	1
10	Deserves all the hype!	This show is so captivating. I'm constantly on the edge of my seat worrying about what's going to happen next only to be met with twists around every corner, it's thrilling! The plot, the character development, the dedication and the suspense. Words cannot do this masterpiece justice. You feel like you're in it every step of the way, so involved, so attached. I cannot stop talking about it! Very intelligent writing, just phenomenal. I will be very sad when this comes to an end.	1
10	Brilliant	This was the best series ever i dont understand the spoilers..i luved it..iam glad i didn't read the reviews on here before i watched it..iam not gonna read the reviews on here anymore i never agree with them..	1
1	This is trash	One the worst series i've seen. I don't really understand the success. It's just a terrible soap opera	0
10	Do not miss this one	One of the best shows i have seen. Amazing acting, direction, casting, storyline.	1
10	Must Watch.	This is a great show, I don't know why some people are giving negetive reviews.	1
10	Entertainment at the highest level	One of the most exhilarating, breath taking and jaw dropping series available. The action moments in the series is one of the most thriller based emotionally heavy scenes that you can expect in television today. I'll rather have the enormous popularity and ground breaking critical acclaim speak for itself. Its a modern revelation which gave a new life to a genre that had been under seize for quite a while, i.e. heist genre, this series gave a new life to this genre, which resonate universal themes across the world.	1
9	Brave and different!!	Well to make a show with so many characters and complex plot it requires guts.Money heist is a great thriller with intense storyline and great actors.This plot is totally different and the show keeps you hooked.Each character has a complex history which is shown beautifully. Well the writers have done a wonderful job every season in maintaining the level of show.To sum it up it is a must watch.	1
10	THRILLER Outstanding	I loved this series so Much. It's Some of the Best Series I have Watched. It's full of Thrill, crime & Suspense. If you have not seen yet You should. The Performance are on next level. No Indian Actor can Match there Level. It's Just Great. Some Illiterate & Arrogant People Says that First 2 Parts are Good, rest are Poor but I Think all the Parts are Phenomenal. Really, the creativity of Spanish makers are Too Good. I Watched 4 parts in 10 Days only. I loved it So much.	1
10	The best	Best TV show, even better then GOT though they are quite different	1
3	Very weak...	I started watching because this show was recommended left and right. The premise looked good enough, but after the S1E2 I found myself skipping the 'romantic' bits. I say romantic, but 'stupid' would be a better word. Countless things in this series don't make any sense. at all. Characters are poorly developed, direction is pretty bad, conversations and motivations are plain weird and nonsensical. At one point the mastermind was having a casual phone conversation with the lead detective while being crushed in a car... I pulled through until the end of S1, but never again. Avoid!	0
1	Overated	This is just telenovela.to much drama in heist action.	0
1	Nonsense	So much hype of this show but not worth it, dont waste your time on this	0
10	Bella ciao, ciao, ciao	Perfect!!! I recommend it to everyone. Hope it never ends.	1
2	Terrible	Some tv shows are terrible and you just dont watch them. This one mixed in some good parts forcing the viewer on an endless journy of good and bad. My theory is they had 2 seasons and washed it down to make 4 seasons, full of flashbacks and endless collages.	0
10	Outstanding series	In the previous parts we can see the heist is totally based on strategies and love. In the fourth part, we can see it's full of emotion with wonderful strategies of the professor and the friendship and bonding between the characters. Now this is not at all a series, This is emotion. Will wait for the fifth part of 'La Casa De Papel' or 'Money Heist'.	1
3	Support dark side	The series well written but it seems to support he dark side, plot showing robbers and criminals as the good people defending them	0
4	Completely Unrealistic	Events, details and changes in characters ethics are completely unrealistic	0
1	Season 4 is disappointing	Season 4 is very slow and disappointing. Writer could have done a better job.	0
1	Nobody dies	No suspense as you know no one dies. Its rubbish and I am really annoyed my teenager made me watch this. It is such a weakly crafted TV show.	0
1	Really?	Poorest acting in the history of cinema.Can't understand this success	0
3	Why so much hype?	I don't get it , I could barely stand season 1. Why most of the people I know are crazy about this totally predictable cliche show. There were exactly 2 moment where I felt like watching an actual heist show.	0
4	When NETFLIX took over	La Casa De Papel (aka Money Heist) was a masterpiece! Until Netflix took over and created Season 2 (Part III & IV). Ending of Season 1 (Part I & II) was perfect, leaving audiences a bittersweet ending. But netflix ruined it by making a sequel and adding back stories from its original supposed to be good story. Look what happened to Riverdale - a total mess after the next few seasons. Please STOP...Just STOP making more seasons. I hope Part V would be the last.	0
1	what a piece of sheet !	"To call this a ""masterpiece"" your EQ must be lower than -10^100"	0
1	Very Bad	The entire season is rubbish, ridiculous and full of cliches and copies of bad American films. Some characters are unnecessary like most of the scenes. Basically is just horrible and underestimate my intelligence.	0
10	Stunner with incredible acti(ng)on	Surprisingly Fantastic plot. A show which literally makes you binge watch the complete season in one go. This show is literally a best example of how one can go in detail and come out with a fantastic story which is true to life.	1
3	fakey, cheesy, boring...8.8? wtf!?	I felt obligated to leave a review after seeing the 8.8 rating on IMDB. this is a wannabe Oceans 11 that fails miserably. the plot is so fakey. season 1 is 13 episodes & nothing happens. save your time. almost every character is awful. the dialogue & character development is embarrassing. I really wanted to like this but it was impossible.	0
10	For those claiming that it is not realistic	And to add up. It is realistic, just based on intelligence and clever thoughts. If that's not enough, go watch a documentary or something, which I assure u it's 100% true😘	1
1	Lip sync unwatchable!	What's up with Netflix movies lately?! The actors words don't even match their mouth's. It's just unwatchable.	0
8	Bigger heist, bigger mistakes	I was worried part 3 wouldn't be as good as parts 1 and 2 however I was happily surprised were the story went, showing how things can fall apart very quickly. The acting is great and the character flaws are realistic and enjoyable to watch, I can't wait for part 4 the only question is will I have any finger nails left due to the nerves of having to wait another year.	1
4	A Clunker with a Capital C	Improbable story, head police lady wore blouse showing half her assets, makes love to bad guy not knowing he was bad guy, voice over woman was reading from printed page at all times and in general the whole darn show just stunk but I watched it anyway. I learned a good lesson for future Netflix series/movies. It I think they stink, quite watching. Thanks for education, NetFlix. I love you anyway.	0
1	Too fake	"So don't waste your time on this, the cops shoot at a burglar too only injure him "" yeah right "" Like in the movie wanted the bullet curves but only injures but still the burglar manages to kill his opponents."	0
1	8,5 Rating !!! Come On pls	Seriously there is nothing much to write about this series , but season 4 is something different as it is the biggest joke i have ever watched !! No way i still can not believe how they are gonna produce more seasons of this trash show .	0
1	Very bad , just wasting time	Since long time, I noticed that Netflix tv show has high good rating here , but i said it's a different opinion, but after this show i'm sure that most rating is fake.. so don't depend on it.	0
10	One of the Best Shows I have ever seen	I have finished watching all the episodes of La Casa de Papel in 2,5 days. The story is detailed, the acting is awesome, the music is excellent, I loved everything about it. It's an extremely good show which I believe, I will watch it for a few times more. I strongly advice you to watch it.	1
10	One of the greatest series I have ever seen	"So when I started watching in the first moment I was in shock of how good it was and now with season 3 I was so shocked, like everything was perfect, in any moment I was like ""that was boring or they should have put that"" I was perfect, I watched in 1 day and I can't wait for the next season"	1
10	One of my favorites!	This is my first ever review. when i was watching the trailer i did not think i would like this series at all. But after i had watched the first episode i fell in love. It gets more and more exiting by every episode that goes and you cant stop watching because you just want to know what will happen.	1
10	Wonderful piece of work	"Wow! Where did that came from? Totally unexpected, exciting, thrilling and yet full of action, smart but grounded and realistic series.

I drank it all in 4 days. All two seasons and in one word: overwhelming.

Totally recommended!"	1
1	Don't get fooled by a first few episodes	"Straight to the point, this is very bad made, plot holed, over-dramatic, make-no-sense-at-all show. Its a complete waste of Your time, every ""mind game"" or twist shown has almost no sense or any base. I can bring over 20 plot holes easily, but I won't make spoilers on a review.

Please, make yourself a favor, stay out of this."	0
10	I NEVER rate things as a 10- this is truly worth watching	Unbelievable. Phenomenal acting, superb plot and overall amazing. No series has ever hooked me with an interest so great such as this one - and I don't even speak Spanish! I found this to be an extremely good series, and can hardly compare it to many others. I would strongly recommend any other person to watch this series, as it's suspense and excitement keeps you clicking 'next episode' as you are filled with adrenaline. It truly is impossible to sleep through or get bored of this series.	1
10	I have seen many... but this is the one...	Non-violent action-thrilling-love-suspense experience. Great characters. Great plot.I want more	1
10	1 word, WOW	One of those tv series that leave you stucked to the chair starring at the screen after its over with the feeling that you dont believe it came to an end	1
1	Bad	Painful to watch This show is just awful and bad I didn't like it🤢	0
10	The best	This is the best TV series I've ever watched. Every single part is awesome. I never thought that i will love crime tv shows.	1
1	Don't expect much.	Absolute waste of time. One of the most naive shows I have ever seen.	0
2	ejjjj	"The first 13 episode was extreamly good, but the last 6 was the oposit. its ok, the first part has some big mistake

spoiler

like the professor portrait scene with the russian, but the serial is good, i give a chance and was unstoppable to watch an other episode.

but the last 6 episode is just annoying. drama, drama, drama, the jokes are missing, the pro robbers become amateurs. the episodes become lame, like all the convesations. talk talk talk, but nothing interesting.

poor serial. :( li"	0

9	Speechless	"Just finished watching season 5 and you guys have outdone yourself.

I thought may be it would not click this time...but I am speechless right now....and Tokyo 😭😭😭😭"	1
1	Overrated	Thinks it's a very smart and intelligent show but the fact is it's a very tacky and massy show. People with good taste should stay away, it only caters to dumb audiences.	0
10	Best I've seen in years	Simply great, watch it and accept to lose real friends because you watch day and night. Get yourself sucked in so hard that the main chatacters become your new friends and feel sorry if you lose them too. Divorce your wife because you fell in love with Tokio and search desperate for something else to watch with similar content - or actors. Oh well, just watch it again - nobody will know since by now it's only you and the TV.	1
9	One of the BEST crime thriller available . Best robbery series with perfect story telling.	Loved this series , best robbery crime web series in the world , I would recommend all to watch this at least once , cant wait for season 5.	1
10	Don't listen to the idiots who give this show bad rating	The show itself is awesome. The idiots writing dumb ratings are not.	1
2	Review of « La Casa de Papel »	This serie has seen a lot of twists. The scénario is inspired by other histories but not copy identical. The ideas are good but production is less. The serie know a lot of suspense	0
2	Uma trampa	Não faz sentido algum a história desta série. Trata se de uma trampa	0
3	What a mess	This was truly paiful to watch and I was struggling to even finish it.	0
3	Too much of a soap opera	The title says exactly that. Just get the robbery done and go. I don't care to see a bunch of nude and sex scenes. I fast forward through so much stuff. I couldn't wait until the end. Thank God. They all got away, the end.	0
8	La Casa De Papel	No matter how silly it is, the action never stops. But I didn't always want new episodes to come, it should have ended where it ended in the Spanish version.	1
4	Overated	A way to pass time while exercising. The first few episodes drew me in but I find the characters unlikable as the story progresses.	0
10	The movie sweet die! (Another way of saying the movie is super interesting)	How i wish there is morethan 10stars for me to rate this movie. This is definitely the all time best.	1

1	Disgusting crew that supports racism and apartheid	"I watched a few episodes and I wanted to watch more especially after the new season came out but after I found out how the crew was interviewed by an Israeli guy channels and how they praised the apartheid Israeli system against Palestinian civilians I definitely won't be watching this show.

No excuse to support Israeli army or police or any of the Israeli entities that kill and harass Palestinians on daily basis!"	0

10	all of LCDP is worth watching.	I agree with the fact that season 3&4 were unnecessary but some people keep saying that seasons 3 & 4 were UnReAliStiC. And Im like was is realistic from the begging of the series? I agree seasons 1 & 2 were incredible but the rest of the series were also beautiful and magical.	1
10	Best web series I been ever seen	Everyone should watch this series.too exiting and thriller.	1
1	what? 😭	"How is this garbage has 8.3 rating? Are you kidding me? 😭 laughable plot that doesn't make sense, trying so hard to make it intellectual but what a fail.

No character development at all, nothing, just some people fighting with guns and a little of stupid quotes to post on instagram. 6/10 at it's best."	0
2	Logic committed suicide	Seriously don't understand what the hype is all about. Looks like people just want to show off to the world that they own a Netflix subscription to make themselves look cool. Apart from the cinematography this series sucks big time! I mean seriously, go and watch good quality content like Breaking Bad, Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire etc. Watched 4 seasons but not interested for any upcoming episodes at all!	0
2	Good actors but bad story	The first season was very intriguing and exciting. Second season appeared as though the story was lost and fillers were put in to complete the season. The more episodes I watched the more logic was lost. Would have been a good show if the series had better logic and was concise. Pity the talented actors	0
3	Beware of ANY show past season 2.	I can count on one finger the number of shows that were good past season 3, maybe 3 that were good past season 2. I expected it to get laughable and it was.	0
3	Overated	Starts well but descends into stupidity dragging out the story lines and becoming more far fetched with every passing minute.	0
1	Too woke.	Season 1 and 2 was really good. After that show became a nonsense woke mess. Abort, abort	0
1	its better to sign a contract with marvel	I dont know why when a sereies see people positive reaction writers of that series try to act them like stupids. what is this rude manner? a bank guardian turn to superman or what? 4 armed man couldnt even make a hit to him? is he bullet proof or what?? you were brilliant but now, nothing. you are fool not us. make fool of yourself. try to respect people. add fantasy and science fiction to headline of your series	0
3	Offensive & Unwatchable	I tried hard to fight back nausea, hoping to give it a chance. However the male characters are so unbearable, You're hoping the couple females will go movie theater with automatic weapons and give male characters torture due to them for grotesque behaviors. I generously skipped ahead to see if any improvements exist, but nope. Dont waste your time here.	0
4	so many plot holes	"I just gave up on this one, the character interactions were too forced and the character back stories just didn't make sense. Most of the show your waiting for something to happen but they just keep cramming sex into the story, or start copying other movies plot lines like ""inside man (2006)"". Seems like any international movie/series project now gets high reviews for the sake of being international or something... if it's garbage it's garbage no matter where it comes from."	0
10	Perfect	Start forom the season one withe a great idea end to session two withe a great end	1
2	Incredibly Bad	In retrospect, it would have been merciful to have the lady inspector and the mint manager eliminated very early in the story, followed closely by all the other misfit characters that populate this travesty. Other than that, it was OK.	0
2	I just can't believe how overrated this series is...	It's so predictable, the plot is just weak, but the most irritating and frustrating part are caracters. They're completely onedimentional, stereotypical, which gives to the series the vibe of a chilidish game. I've hatewatched the first season and started the second one in hope I finally see what most of the reviewers saw. But I just can't stand it anymore... The only positive aspect of it is that I could practice my Spanish a bit	0
3	Interesting premise, but descends into flawed plot and acting	As other reviewers here, I was drawn in by the high rating. The initial idea had promise but from the start the English dubbing gave it a weird artificial tone. I gave it a few episodes to improve but it descended into absurd story lines and increasing poor acting. I, too, wonder if people have artificially inflated the ratings.	0
9	Best of 2017!	La Casa De Papel is the best series after Breaking Bad!	1
10	PERFECT	I recommand this serie for every single one it's one of the greatest things that i ever watched how the characters were chosen and the story is great MAGNIFICO	1
4	laughably bad tv show	"Everything about this show is bland and cliche. The show started with a nice idea but the execution is so bad feels like 3 years old wrote the script.

The main cast of characters was at first introduced as pro thieves and later they turn out to be bunch mindless amateurs... the police are even worse the dumbest police u can find in any tv show.

Oh and the romance is so bad and stupid... 100% cringe material

Finally to finish on a good note i guess ... the only thing i liked is Berlin

3.5/10"	0
4	has to be only S02	Total waste of time .. Boring... S01, 02 was best , but further Sessons are worse.	0
10	Finest web series	Each and every short is a gem to watch. A Series that teach others to frame shorts.	1
1	Why can't I give zero stars?	I didn't watch season 2, 3, 4 and 5. I gave up after 4 episodes in season 1. Easily one of the worst series out their and definetely the most overhyped ever. Hello everyone? It was terrible from the very beginning!	0
4	Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché	I watched 7 episodes because people insisted this show was good, I kept giving it a chance until eventually I gave up on liking it. I think this show is for people that have not watched enough movies and quality series, it copies plots from everywhere, there is nothing original about it, maybe that it is in spanish?	0
10	Who knew this would be sooo good!!!	A Spanish mini-series more than holds up to the best heist movies of all time. Great plot, great characters and intense sequences throughout. Thoroughly enjoyed, you will too!	1
1	Did you really like it?	Cheap entertainment. Lazy script, completly inverosimil scenes. I've did'nt understood why Tokio act like that. What's her problem?. Was very good idea, but completly wasted.	0

9	Heist	Good first heist, the second one...mmh. But can't wait anyway for the next season.	1
10	Awesome!	"Not since ""24"" have I enjoyed a TV show this much. Are there moments that are a bit unrealistic? Of course - but it's so much fun I just don't care! This is what Hollywood has forgotten how to do - just tell a damn good story. Don't watch it with an English soundtrack though - it's awful. Watch in Spanish audio with subtitles and revel in the glorious atmosphere of Spanish crime. Bella Ciao!"	1
4	Completely overrated - I think people might like this show cause there's not much else to do during the pandemic	I started watching because so many people recommended this show to me and the ratings were so good. The only good thing about this show is the original idea of the robbery. Otherwise it's many many episodes where barely anything happens, it' extremely boring and super annoying with the plot not making any sense, the characters making stupid, rooky mistakes after preparing for months and so much unnecessary drama and stupid dialogues. If the overall rating would've been between 6 or 7, I would think that's acceptable. But in comparison to all the hype, it's garbage.	0
4	Only Season 1 was great	Season 1 was the right combination of a clever heist plot, drama, action, and a love story. Season 2 was still okay as a follow-on. But Season 3 and 4 were a complete waste of time. New characters, endless love twists, and complete disregard to common sense led to its fall.	0
4	Just... bad	Maybe the good reviews are about the basic premise of the story, which is interesting and carries the series. But the scenes are so implausible, and the script reflects how little the writers/showrunner know of real human interactions. What makes it so much worse is the ridiculous misogyny. I see they have a couple of women writers, but it's mostly men, and it is absolutely laughable. I feel sorry for the women writers, it's never easy being a minority in a writers' room.	0
3	Mediocre	This series is mediocre at his best. Everything is wrong. There are a lot of thing that doesn't make sense, the characters suck, writing is terrible and there are too many absurd things. I don't understand how such a show became a cult. I would have given 5 stars for the first two parts but the third and fourth parts are one of the trashest things I've ever seen. If you want to watch it don't take it seriously but watch it as a soap opera because that's what it is.	0
10	best series	Thank you mr.pina for creat a great series like la casa de papel, im persian and a big fan of spanish series and you. please just dont kill the gang in finale....tnQ	1
3	No one really dies in this show	Been binwatching this show and really stupid now. The professor and his team gets aways with everything and none of the his team's dies in the second heist.	0
3	Overrated show..	First of all, plot is good but execution, screenplay, acting, characterization etc utterly poor. Can't find some logic in there. I don't get, how this shows get so much ratings with such nonsense daily soap. Poorly done revision before exam. Netflix should have after stop after 2 season..	0
4	Should have ended with season 2	Thank you my intuition for not watching season 4. And I definitely won't try season 5.	0
1	Time waste series	Seems like a soap opera specially after Season 2. Season 1 and Season 2 are also not in the league of greats. Overall its a below average series with a brilliant premise	0
2	Worst part is they are making Season 5	Like most people here I have to say Season 1 & 2 were entertaining with a lot of foolishness from main characters but you still let it go to see how the heist ends. With Season 3 you already know how it works. It's all rinse and repeat with extra foolishness, non sense plot and cringe worthy acting. I do not have the stamina to go through with Season 4. Good luck to those looking forward to Season 5. Hats off to you...	0
1	Utter utter rubbish	If your are reading this, do not watch this show. Its utter utter nonsense. Total rubbish.	0
8	Hollywood is pale with envy	I am constantly imagining the faces of producers and directors in Hollywood, wondering why they haven't been able to get such a format of this quality in recent years. Most probable solution: soon we will be served a more wanted than skilful imitation à la Hollywood.	1
3	Was OK until Part 4	8 episodes and literally one would have done, and it didn't conclude, so I assume is back for a Part 5. Lets hope that the writers get some inspiration during lick down that will bring it back to its former glory	0
8	Tokyo is so overrated and pathetic acting	Tokyo is so overrated and pathetic acting, the rest of the cast are so awesome.	1
4	Overacting and Horrible Voice Dubs	This started as a pretty intriguing storyline - sort of like Inside Man or a larger Dog Day Afternoon but in order to stretch it out they killed the momentum of the narrative and then started making characters act in stupid ways just to keep the story going. Because we spend so much more time with these actors, their weaknesses become glaring. Horrible overacting but the English voice dubs are as bad as the kind you would get in bad Kung fu movies of the 70's.	0
1	"Terrible ""Inside man"" copycat"	Poor acting Plot has plenty of weak points and nothing original If you watched inside man, one movie is 10 times more authentic and thrilling than this weak show. Unless you never watched any great American show in the last 10 Years then go ahead and enjoy it	0

1	#free_Palestine	The series is against the injustice that people are subjected to under the hegemony of violent policies, yet the actors promote the Zionist occupation that robs the Palestinians of their homeland and homes, killing their souls in cold blood.

10	10/10,Amazing	This has got to be by far the best show I have ever seen. It's a roller coaster of emotions. I can assure you if you want him this show you will never be bored.o have watched the whole show and it truly was the best show I've seen and I've watched a lot of shows.it's got action,romance,drama and more. I've watched this multiple times and every single time I watch this it just never gets boring. I would 100% recommend this show.10/10.	1
8	5season not upto the mark	Why is there so much of drama in 5th season We're not here to watch drama always there is good situation you put a person who does mistake can't be accepted everytime. Show is good but logics are poor.	1
9	I really enjoyed watching it	A high dose of adrenaline and various feelings in one.	1
10	Captivating	"This will leave you wanting more, the writers are masters of cliff hangers.

I don't like to binge but this show forces you too.

You end up cheering for the bad guys only to later determine you dont really think they are the bad guys.

The script is plausible and the acting is great."	1
4	Pretty illogical	Starts of ok. Then it gets very illogical in most parts. Overall, im not sure how this got a 8+/10 positive reviews... Dialogue gets boring & many scenes seem unnecessary as though it was meant to be dragged on... and on .. and on...It could have really been a good heist movie... Unfortunately, that's not the case here... Im giving it a 4/10...	0
4	Season 1 is fun, but...	I really enjoyed first several episodes. It was intriguing to see what will happen next and that was all. There are so many nonsenses that completely ruin what could've been really great show. Characters are just stupid and childlish, the plot becomes un-believeable and I was very annoyed towards the end od season 1. Couldn't bother with season 2..	0
1	Don't bother watching past season 2	Good season 1 made me watch season 2. Shut your brain off for season 2 cuz it's straight garbage from there. The high ratings are consistent with season 1 quality though.	0
1	Great until they decided to continue it	Season 1 was great with the first robbery but as the show progressed it was apparent that there was no content left to drag and felt unessacery. Everything after the first heist was a pain to watch and should not have been there. Watch the first heist and then STOP.	0
2	Doesn't make sense	This movie is a soap opera. I can't get it why a criminal should fall in love with a police. It is really stupid. In real life never happened. The love story between characters in this movie completely ruined everything and sometimes you think that doesn't worth to watch it.	0
3	Over rated nonsense soap opera.	Shut your brain off before watching, nothing makes sense and it would be enjoyable if you did or didn't have a brain at all, don't get the hype....	0
9	The art of heist twist & turn	I loved the flick . It's great that Netflix is coming up with such series because this series was a flop in Spain but hit globally after Netflix acquired it .Every element story , content , screenplay & some spices of twist & turn that you as viewer will completely unexpect . I completely got addicted with this & it stayed with me for some time when I completed the seasons . Having said that do avoid it if you don't like violence .	1
9	A Masterpiece Series	Very well written screenplay. The narration of the story is very good and thrilling. A simple concept developed into fine story, and very nicely performed characters. No need to compare it with some good series which indeed had felt boring and flawed at some parts. Comparison makes the entertainment awful.	1
9	Awesome Show	One of best series I've ever watched my advice is stick with it as initially I though it was boring and suddenly you make a breakthrough and see it for the genius it is	1
9	Great show	"Emotional rollacoaster at times. Granted I nearly stopped watching after season 2 but I'm so glad I stuck with it...oh and hey Nairobi ""El Puta Ama"""	1
8	good plot....	"In 2 days i finished watching season 1. the series is really thrilling and exciting and keeps a hold.

Only boring aspect of the series is the personal life of Inspector raquel, it makes you feel like you are watching some 15-20 year old TV Serial when her personal issues are brought up again and again...."	1
2	Suprised that it was this bad	"I have heard about this show for ages and since lock down I thought that I´ll start watch it. Bear in mind that I LOVE most tv-shows.

But Money Heist has to be one of the most boring tv shows. It has a good plot in like the first episode but the problem with the show is the characters, they are SO STUPID and make so many stupid unrealistic decisions throughout the first season.

I watched like 5 of the first episodes and I AM NOT watching any more. I recommend NOT watching gone wrong soap opera."	0
4	Highly Disappointed	Heard such great things about this series. Finally got around to watching it and realize it's disappointing. These are some of the dumbest, undisciplined bank robbers ever. No one watches the hostages, the robbers are all over the bank leaving the hostages unattended. Cops leave the hostage scene to go eat lunch. This is like a longer, worse version of Inside Man, which was actually a good movie. I don't need to see anyone die, but a organized team would be nice. But then again, I'm only 6 episodes in, so maybe it will get better.	0
4	Show me the money	Story showed promise at the start but lost its way, a so called master plan acted out by some of the worst 'career criminals' you'd wish to meet. Only thing successfully stolen here was my time	0
3	1-2 season were great? Don't think so. The whole show is garbage	"I don't understand all the hype around this show. Since the first season it is full of cliches, dumb dialogues, sop opera and gay drama (especially after Netflix picked it up). It's so predictable that you can anticipate the conversation and sometimes even the words the characters are going to say. Many scenes and conversations were so annoying we had to fast forward them. The ideology behind these series is basically one - a bunch of egocentrics trying to get it all convincing all others about their ""noble"" motives.

Could't finish the show. Don't waste your time"	0
4	S P A N I S H S O A P O P E R A O V E R L O A D	"When yiu have free time, go watch other movies.

The first two seasons was nice and interesting. But this goddamn Tokyo, Rio, and Raquel just makes me wanna puke. I pity the actor and actress playing them in the third season. They probably ruined their careers. Absolute disastrous of screen writing that does not sense of relevancy to ita viewers."	0
2	One of the worst series I've ever seen	Same thing that is repeating in every episode just overrated i regret watching it	0
2	Highly Overrated.. Over hyped.. Don't believe	Stopped after watching 5 episodes... After hearing lavish praises from all over this Spanish make .. Tried to give this a try and trust me I have watched lot of other Series this one not what you hear.. Poor narration, characters, story and overall concept instead of robbing the bank you print the money.. God no!!! Save your time..	0
3	Stole my time	A series of extreme logic errors. the scenario is very unreasonable. Harmful to mental health	0
3	Spanish police need retraining	What started out as exciting crime drama has denigrated into a farcical unbelievable black comedy. The keystone behaviour of the Spanish police is unbelievable	0
4	Want to ruin a good series? Netflix it!	"Season 1 was 7/10, had many flaws but was totally watchable. Season 2 was 6/10, too much drama and even more plotholes. Season 3 was 3/10, the downhill continues and you can understand something has changed. The way the story continues... Logic goes out of the window. They just wanted to make money from an already well known succesful series. Season 4 is 2/10 more drama and nonsense than anything i have seen. I literally was laughing many times because of how bad the scenario and the scences were...

Should have definitely stopped after season 2."	0
4	Very imaginary serious.	Very imaginary serious. It doesn't deserve more than 4/10.	0
8	Enough already	I think I would have rated it 9 if it ended on season 2 while the ending for season 2 and the love story between the professor and Rakel was not too convincing for me to mess her life up and she didn't get any Prison time come on and because there is a huge fan base they keep milking them season after season just end it	1
1	Cliche and predictable	"The plot is filled with cliches and plot holes, There's maximum emotional drama and stupid actions by characters. The scenes feel anticlimactic with build up that ends up in nothing. Btw, I'm in mid-season 2 now and I know no one is going to die because the writers don't feel like killing any of the characters

Waste of time (even during quarantine)"	0
1	It is a waste of time	"How can somebody like this series? I have a long list of complains but i will write a few of them here:

1. Why are the kidnappers and hostages horny all the time? One of them even rapes another hostage, btw he was not even kidnap in the first place!

2. Who sings a church song in the middle of a shooting

That is just a few examples. But the series is horrible!"	0
4	A Cliche itself	After two outstanding seasons, it has turned into a cliche itself. Just repeated lines and scenarios we have seen plenty of times IN the show (and meaningless flashbacks used as fillers). It really should have ended in Season 2 (Season 5 and 6 are already announced). Great Cast and acting though.	0
8	Absolutely bingeable series! Season 1 bad 2 -10/10 Season 3 and 4 - 8/10	Don't trust the negative reviews. Definitely worth watching. One and two were logically acc ur age without and plot holes. Season 3 and 4 are dramatic with plot holes and lack of realism, however extremely entertaining just like the first 2 seasons.	1
1	Funny how characters cannot be killed	This show is getting cheaper and cheaper...................	0
8	9* for season 1-2, 7* for 3rd and 3* for season 4	A great series taking a deep dive. ..overstretched with season 4 roaming around one character ( gandia ) . hope the title of the review says it all.	1
1	Too many loopholes and started becoming almost childish..!h..!!	End of season 3 it becomes almost childish..! Still wondering what all the hype is about this show..! Too many loopholes, draggy and senseless scenes..!	0
1	Good, third season unwatchable	The third season was just awful and unwatchable, I give 6 stars for the first two seasons.	0
4	Seems promising at first but gets dumb	Turns out to be a pretty stupid show. If you don't care about things making sense then go ahead, it can still be entertaining to watch.	0
9	Great show!!	What a great show!! Ignore the negative comments. They're either clinically depressed armchair critics or trump supporting racists.	1
8	A great pickup by Netflix	Unexpectedly brilliant, although it would be better if Netflix released all the episodes at once. Also the English dub is somewhat lacking, it's better to watch with the original voices.	1
9	Great work	Allh heists have done a great job especially Álvaro	1
9	Thumbs up!	I've watched the first two seasons. I really liked them! Very interesting plot and characters. Acting is more than decent, as well as the director's work. Quite unpredictable and very adventurous story line. I would definitely recommend it, especially to youngsters who are looking for something exciting and cool. It deserves its fame!	1
9	Amazing!	Amazing doesn't quite cut it. This clever creation was like riding on a roller coaster from start to finish.	1
9	Brilliant	Tokyo is such a bit#h that I hate her. This series is brilliant.	1
3	Every season is gettin' worst..	"What a shame.

Why does a good series have to be lengthened, until it completely loses its identity? This last season, which no longer makes sense and where you no longer believe absolutely nothing of what happens, and neither do you mind you.. This is the last time I hope to get so bored with a serie.."	0
2	What have they done	It was great show but the greed took over and they over did it.. they screwed up good show.	0
1	The show should end in first season	I don't know why the still made more seasons of this show, I think that's a terrible mistake.	0
3	They are so dumb	I get each character brings their own problems but they are a bunch of frak up that continues to frak the situation.	0
1	Dcs	I have to go home otuo but I'll get in. Sad that you have to be with me this.	0
1	Nairobi	Alba flores , you are a great actress and the most important that you are a human Thanks for not being a follower and still stand for human rights ✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼 You are a true character.	0
2	Getting worse season after season	Season one was ok Then came season two which was more about bad words and nude scenes with less story After that it's just bad words and nudes woth 0 story.	0
1	A drama for 63os(and drbawies)	"Had to watch even though i knew it wasn't that good because of how people were hyped for it..never been more disappointed especially after the first season...As they always say : worst things comes in two"" .. However in this case it came in 4 because we have 4 seasons of a milked story.

All i have to say to this bad overrated series is : Bella ciao Bella ciao Bella ciao ciao ciao."	0
1	.	Dont ask me for the 1 star rating. Ingaging the political situation with some worthless ppl is too dump, rating this with 1 star is the maximum i could give.	0
4	Could have done better if it could have been kept at 2 seasons	"Season 1 a blast and season 2 ok, but after that it went south, wasted my time though.

Why drag it when things can end in the best quality ?

Quality matter not quantity."	0
10	Theory: What happened to Tokyo in money heist season 5? it's really ...?	"In the series, we saw that Tokyo is the narrator of the story. But when she died, you were probably shocked! Maybe he survived !! But how?

We did not see the exact location of the grenade explosion. Gandía may pick up grenades and But grenades explode in his hands when he returns to throw them then land in Tokyo, or throw them in an elevator."	1
1	It gets boring at the end	It's really nothing special and they hint and supporting Is real.	0
1	I don't get the hype	It was Very disappointing +wasted my time .everyone kept talking non stop about this season yet yet it was so bad and boring to a point I had to force myself to watch it hoping it will get better yet it DIDNOT!!! SMH.	0
1	Waste of time	They will steel nothing but your time , should be ended at season 1 worst show ever.	0
4	The more seasons you watch the more bored you get	"I rated this show 10 at first season, after season 4 I changed it to 4.

If you want to enjoy it just watch season 1 and 2."	0
9	Masterpeace for 2 seasons	Like many others have written I also agree that the first 2 seasons was a masterpiece. Then they just tried to stretch it until it got bad. I pulled myself thru season 3 but then I stopped watching.	1
4	Should've ended at Season 2	"My previous rating was 8 now it's 4.

The first & second season are good, worth watching. Rest of them are just horrible."	0
10	Berlin, a piece of art!	I loved the series very much. I highly recommend you to watch this web-series. One of the best shows i have ever seen.	1
10	Awesome	It is the best series. Mastermind behind the heist is wordless.	1
10	Very Good Hiest Series	I have seen this series many times. I never get bored. The character of the professor is very good in this and also from Berlin, Tokyo. All its owners are very good, thieves do not make any mistake in it.	1
10	Awesome	4 Seasons are Upto the Mark.. Go for it.. Personally My Top 3 Series... Love from India..... I'm surprised why rating is not above 9.5 to these series..........................	1
8	Very good show	Love that show and it's the percect exemple that other countries can also produce great shows.	1
10	Big Fan	I Would Like To Rate It 10 Star Cause This Spanish Series Blow Off I Really Like Heist Movies And I Love The Intense And Frightening Scenes I Love It Can't Wait To Watch Part 5.	1
10	Best	One of the Best web series on Netflix... Also want to appreciate Hindi dubbing artists... Such a jem you guys are.	1
8	Probably should have ended after Part 2	The first heist (part 1-2) was perfection. The second heist (part 3-4) was a bit out of hand, some poor acting in unimportant roles, and concepts that were beyond ridiculous. Still good though.	1
10	It's raining money	Larger than life ambitions and real life execution with a sharp brain and well crafted screenplay... Keeps you on the edge throughout.. one of the best money heist plots	1
9	strictly awesome	Twists and turns ,well planned robberies a perfect crime	1
9	Smartest Suspens Story in Morden Times	Watched after all four seasons released. It's phenomenal story, character & all ther thing you want to watch in good web series. Felt after completing fourth season ,makers must stop after second part, because story & creative end there after that they create unnecessary drama and one more robbery to take to 5th & final part of season. Must watch for all. You will love all character and remember too long	1
9	Great mix of nerv-breaking action and relation drama	A great series mixning high paced action with relation drama and smart unexpected solutions. Highly recommended. The only negative is that as the seasons go on you start to anticipate how things will evolve, though still great entertainment!	1
9	LIKE MORE 3RD AND 4TH SEASON	True first 2 seasons were like soap opera, but 3rd and 4th got even better for me. I did like it a lot. Good series actually. Waiting for the last season!	1
8	Season 1-4 Review: Very Good - (8.0)	"Watched the series in Netflix. Series is very much thrilling, engaging and addicting.
Series started good 1st and 2nd season were very good (The first 13 episodes). I found the 3rd season little dissapointing than the rest and 4th season was good as 1 and 2.
Performance wise everyone did a great job. Show has great characters.
Story wise it's good, but there were few loop holes where luck favors the professor more than 1 time.
Waiting for the 5th season."	1
9	La Casa de Papel	I like it very much, and I can grasp the rhythm of the last section very well. Love Berlin and Moscow. People are not machines. No matter how well planned they are, they can't escape from feelings. Feelings are the biggest variable here. If you want to find loopholes and imprecise places, you can find as many as you want, but it doesn't matter to me. The whole play has a good grasp of rhythm, a good characterization, and each character's characteristics are in place. The whole play is to attract people and then look down.	1
8	BRILLIANT SHOW	I personally found that this show is brilliantly craved that give much more entertainment to the audiences.	1
9	Surprising story, well done.	I read some of the negative reviews and I was a little surprised that someone called it dumb. Anything can be improved but this is a good story, well acted, well directed. Its nice to see Madrid giving Hollywood a little competition. I watched the dubed English version, i wish I knew Spanish, I am sure it would be much better. I highly recommend it.	1
1	Overacted series	Following same strategy as others.once become hit need to drag it and making it worse Professor average actor his wife is a disaster..remove that old lady from this...sentimental drama in between ...arturo,angel,Moscow what kind of actors are these....worse really worse....so many other seiries are better than this ...so fortunate they are to be on top which is not deserved	0
2	Had potential but just gets stupid	Becomes quite boring quite quickly. Inside man was a way better heist. Man on a ledge or rapid exchange. This is just boring soap opera garbage.	0
3	A poor soap opera wrapped in a dodgy heist	"I've given it 3 stars to match the number of episodes I could stomach. This show lost me when the crims started behaving like poor cliches of soap characters. Caring more about the personal lives of the hostages & police than the actual task at hand... who does that? So unbelievable I had to give up. Reading some of the ""critic"" reviews has caused me to question whether or not they have seen the same show I tried to watch."	0
1	Overrated too many plot holes	Way too many plot holes no room for creativity. Yes it leaves you on the edge of your seat because you don't know what happens next but it's one of those shows that nothing ever goes wrong in the show. Season 2 is the true finale, got canceled in Spain then Netflix bought it and ruined it. It's like soap opera way too many lo e stories for an action series. They fooled me and don't let them fool you too. So many love scenes, gay scenes, a transexual character which made no sense	0
4	Please don't watch	Most pointless tv show I have seen in a long time...still can't figure out how this crap is so much hyped.... please don't waste your time by watching these....you can watch the entire season of money heist still can't figure out why so much hyped.....	0
3	Wannabe prison break..	On season 2 only as of now. S02e05 .. wat stupidity yar. That hospital scene.. then that hostage rebel scene.. it doesn't seem real at all ..	0
1	Average	"Plot is similar to ""Prison Break"" but very bad version of it! I couldn't wait the next episodes of ""Prison Break""! This one? ""ehhh"""	0
4	stereotype	Serbs arent war criminals.Also first 2 brilliant season	0
8	A Brilliant first 2 Seasons	"10/10 for the first 2 seasons

5/10 for the rest

It should have been ended at season two."	1
4	"Another ""Prison Break & Lost"" TV far too many season"	Just like Lost and Prison brake this series started off great but then went down hill fast! but the 3rd season you start asking yourself this is unbelievable with some episodes just used as fillers, Maybe I'm looking for too much in it but if your going to pull off a big job like this why would you get involved with the copper in charge of capturing you! I Gave up watching and still being constantly reminded from Netflix to watch this.	0
4	Sloppy writing since s3	Plot holes everywhere, unnecessary political correctness topics and sex topics forcefully wrote into the script, Netflix needs to wake up, these are the things ruining good IP, I mourn for these good series.	0
2	Over efficiency	So much over efficiency in the last season moving one to another countries in no time etc etc...	0
4	Overrated and Not needed Hype!	The TV show is nothing but a bunch of mind fucked lunatics hired by The Professor (Who has a well plan, but coud execute it properly). It appeared that felt headache watching this show. Poor cast, poor acting, poor content, poor Dialogues, messed up TV series. And here I can tell you with all this hype for this show, People don't want content and acting. No respect for Real Cinema. Sad!	0
4	If Disney made a heist movie	"Poor, lazy and predictable writing. Heard good things so I gave it a go but very disappointing. If your idea of a good show is bad characters, scenes full of coincidence to suit the story, terribly predictable attempt of 'cliff hangers"" and a cringey love story thrown in then this will be the show for you. I expect these things when I watch certain shows and can get on board.... not a heist movie."	0
3	Season 4 waste of time.	First time in my life I feel like that for a serie. The first two season are great. This has an Awful screenplay and a lot of fake scenes. Nothing to do with the robbery. They are trying to make robbers heroes	0
2	This is a disaster!	The last season destroyed this Serie. All long and romantic dialogues with out sense. It gradually became a soap opera. This happens when you pressure writers to do something that was already ending.	0
4	NOT GOOD AT ALL	The story is very good, but the direction is very bad. The scene that Gandía is shot by more than 100 machine gun shots and not a drop of blood does come close to ridicule. To make matters worse, in the next scene a pistol shot is capable of knocking him down.	0
3	Don't watch it if you have lack of patience	I'm a big fan of season 1 and 2. Good and original idea, spanish producion ( not the usual american cliché crap ) and good plot. But since Netflix decided to buy the series, it all went down. S4 is complete nonsense, lacks of olot	0
2	First season amazing, the rest is fluff	"I loved first season and the final of the third (which gave me the energy to try the fourth season)

No spoiler, just fake fiction: slow story after the idea of the first season, predictable, action show with no action"	0
4	Downhill like mountain bike with their annoying characters and also overated.	"Signed up just to write this comment.

Season 1 is great with its mastermind robbery but it gets really annoying by tokio character keeps ruining everything with her improvisation in the following season. Not really best acting either. My advise is to watch it as a white noise on your tv not for the thrill, let alone for the plot. You'll get annoyed and ended up doing house chores."	0
3	Real dumb robbers!!!	I think the show is overrated.The concept and idea is great but it just gets really dumb as the show goes on. The makers weren't clear of their audience s I guess and have added a lot of unnecessary stuff.For me,the series just had too many flaws!	0
3	Way to long	Good from the start. But then it's just the same and the same and the same.	0
9	Bad voice overs.	Enjoyed series only thing that spoilt it was the English voices they used,was like watching an old karate film from 60's and 70's.I normally wouldn't watch it for that reason alone but it had me gripped early on,so give it a go I think you will be surprised.	1
9	Masterpiece: You never will know whats coming next!	I agree: truly masterpiece and You will never know whats coming next, like the usual action tv series. You will expect one turn but whats coming next will oposite. Thats truly wounderful art of work and performance.	1
3	Poor story	"As Alison said at a time, 8 ppl went to rob ""la casa de papel"". A genius guy who is planning this in every detail choose 'these' people to do the job! They're all psychologically destroyed. Was he (the Professor) blind to see it?"	0
9	FANTASTIC! A MUST WATCH!	A great watch! Full of surprises, nail-biting suspenses and great acting by the actors made this series one of the bests that I have ever watched. Don't wait anymore and start watching!	1
8	It is good	"It is the best spanish series at the moment but some events in the series are just stupid and ""Science Fiction"" the series has a lot of spanish love and the action is really stupid at some times But the series contains a lot of situation twists an it and keeps you with ""The Breath in your Mouth""."	1
8	Astonishing	Every character is nicely written And Berlin is so amazing, Berlin is best written character in the show. Sometimes you feel that they are overreacting or story is not on the trail but it is just for few seconds otherwise the whole show is amazing	1
8	Great series	It started out a little slow, but after a few episodes the story really starts to get interesting. The two intertwining storylines of the robbers inside the mint and the professor dealing with the police, each facing problems, is exhilarating. At the end of an episode you'll often think: are they gonna make it? Did the professor forsee this? Seeing the police's perspective as well was very interesting. An action-packed, well-written storyline, with good acting. Definitely worth a watch.	1
8	Testing	Testing and testing testing testing testing testing	1
8	The series is good, though too long !	"The story is great, just like the heroes, acting. But the impression is that after writing or shooting about 5 or 6 episodes as a whole, for some reason it was decided to extend this series artificially and so they added a whole bunch of ""philosophical"" dialogues and speeches, which mostly have nothing to do with the main great (!) story line, thus turning this show into a total of 15 episodes!

Nevertheless, this is totally worth watching (often fast-forwarding the long talks :) )"	1
10	Highly recommended!	This show is great, it has action, suspence, drama, mistery and comedy in it. The show reminded me of one of my favourite shows, Prison Break.	1
3	3rd season is actually same with 1st and 2nd	Another robbery of national bank etc. Another police tent with military and policemen. Another character returns like Tokyo did in previous seasons. Another team member dies. Another downfall and as usual season ends in the middle of everything. Come on!!! Do something different than previous seasons!!!!!	0
1	Other reviews are clearly paid	"Seriously where to start with this crap of TV Show. It's clearly a hyped show by the channel that produced.

Characters: shallow, hard to identify with any of them especially with any of the main ones Plot: Too many holes. It's the ""pointing gun at others festival"".

Save yourself few hours of your life"	0
10	This Is An Excellent Bank Robbery Series - Totally Enjoyable To Watch	04/24/2020 I watched and finished the first two (2) seasons a long time ago and loved watching the characters/actors in it as the storyline played out. When season two ended, I thought that it was also the end of the series and now, just by accident, see that there are two new seasons to watch. I'm looking forward to seeing how this extended bank robbery series plays out? Bon Appetit'	1
1	8.4 rating?	"I suffered through 5 episodes of this absolutely awful excuse for TV. It's even more poorly written and less believable than the plot and character set of The Walking Dead.

I see that it's really highly rated and that's fine. I guess if you're a complete idiot then this show will really knock your socks off. If you however want to avoid having your intelligence insulted, some of the worst narration ever written but also some laughs (at how bad it is), then I'd find something else.

Anyone who likes this, seriously, don't procreate."	0
9	Absolutely masterpiece	No spoilers:- Money heist is an amazing series to watch with crime scenes. It is for adult not monors.Its full of action enjoyment, fear, tension, grief etc. It's worth to watch u can watch it will not disappoint it's the best and I'm eagerly waiting for season 5.	1
1	A complete sht Show	A TV show that glorifies bank robbery filled with sexual escapades. Wow. What a theme to capture viewers and audience. I saw only the 1st season complete, after 2nd Season Ep 1, I switched to Dark, and I am not disappointed at all. Its a shame they want to release more seasons of this horrible series.	0
10	Love it	I don't understand why people get annoyed if something is unrealistic. All action movies/shows are like that. You actually think someone could execute a robbery as big as that? Just enjoy the story, characters, cinematography and effort put in it. It's not a documentary, it's action series.	1
3	'Lost' version of a heist	Oh, common. This is more like a money heist perpetrated by the LOST producers. You are in the final episode and the turbine of the plane that crashed in the first episode is still spinning. Common. I don't get the hype over this. Try it, if you like, you are with the majority. I tried 4 times and this won't work for me.	0
9	DeathNote	Good show, The professor reminds me of Light Yagami from Death Note	1
10	Best series of a lifetime	"This series will tell you what an actual series is. I mean hollywood looks pale after watching this. the brains behind that voice, the connection with the people. WE ARE THE RESISTENCE .Please b Beware- This show will give u chills. A must watch for every series lover. Don""t miss it. i mean it guys. Just don""t"	1
10	Just finish the season 4 It was amazing!!	Just amazing!! But I think 8 part is too minor.. you should release 100 part at once.!!	1
10	Judt finished 4th Season. I love to give 10/10.	It is really amazing,all episodes are well directed, acting is superb especially Professor. Good investment of your precious time.I recommended we all should see it. Seriously love it.Eagerly waiting for the next season.	1
4	Disappointed!	Hate it! Bad cinematography, bad writing, bad acting....how is this show rated so highly? Feels like a polished Indian tv series with some twists. Disappointed.	0
10	best series to watch	Best bank robbery ever seen every details covered if you are not watching this then die...	1
1	ABSORBING PAPER - SERIES 1&2	"I am almost through the 3rd series and can honestly say there had not been a moment where I haven't been immensely entertained and enthralled.

Fantastic characters set in really smart plots and great cinematography. Slick made for TV series that would do well on the big screen except that I wouldn't want to cut a minute!

Watch in the original soundtrack you avoid it sounding corny!!!

Just love it!!!"	0
10	I wish everyone can read the messages between the line.	This movie is awesome full of awareness and consciousness, hat down and bowed hands for all tge staff behind this marvellous work 🙏	1
3	Childish	3rd season nicely directed but thats all. Story is childish even for a Sci fi enthusiast.	0
9	Coudn't stop!	"I heard from different people that this would've been a very good series. The moment I got sick for a week I started to watch this series. And couldn't stop watching it. I got through every single episode of the first two season in just a week, which is very fast for me, since I'm bored very fast.

It's not a 10 for me, but it is close to a 10!"	1
10	Spectacular!!!	I have never written a review about anything before. I've never seen the point. But this show is the most spectacular shows I have ever seen, EVER. I am honestly beside myself with how fantastically this show was written and directed. I don't normally watch shows that aren't in English because I don't like to read the subtitles, but this show is so incredible suspenseful and is woven together so perfectly and is just honestly one of the most ingenious stories I have ever seen. Absolutely fantastic.	1
8	Good Plot	I would say this is one of my top 5 tv series i've ever watched. It starts with a good plot. The acting is perfect and there are no random/boring scenes to just extend the episodes. I watched all the episodes in something like 3 days, very interesting. If you are bored and want something to watch, watch this! You'll not regret!	1
9	Interesting Script	Let's make everyone equal without harming anyone. Though economists won't agree. But this isn't for them. I'm a young entrepreneur and watching this gave me lots of life lessons. Research, imagine, modify, reimagine and implement. A must watch !	1
1	Sorry from india	Our idiots like anything that resembles closely to Bollywood Plot's that's why shows like this are always on trending but shows like sens 8 don't get much attention our idiots just some how got to imbd for giving a 10/10 rating for this show. Miguel Ángel Silvestre regrets.	0
1	Supporting an imaginary entity	"The actors are supporting the imaginary entity called ""Israel"" under the name of the show and its popularity.

Such a shameful move.

Not cool.

Palestine is very important to Arabs generally and Muslims specially.

We've been taught that there's nothing called isreal before learning the alphabet."	0

10	Great Show	Show is great. Not sure why there are so many Palestinian terrorists in these reviews. 🇮🇱	1
1	The team supports the violations of the Israeli occupation against the Palestinians	The team supports the violations of the Israeli occupation against the Palestinians.	0
1	Hypocrisy	When the series is all about fighting and resisting the corruption of governments then the directors of the show go out on a TV interview with the biggest corrupted occupational power in this modern world and complement them it takes away the heart of the reason of this series and it shows they only care about money and not the purpose! Disappointed!!! Hate the fact that I was a fan at some point.	0
1	Worst thing I've ever watched	Do NOT watch it Don't know what can possibly be worse than this.	0
1	Overrated and boring	This is a soap opera and not a good one. It is really not about there great hiest, but all about feelings and stupid people making stupid feeling based actions. So boring and lame that it wont get more then 1 star from me.	0
10	Money Heist is back!	Back to the compelling master work that took the world by storm back in its first season. After a dip in the quality of the writing in season 3 and 4, season five restores the magic of the initial seasons. Too bad we won't get the last 5 episodes until Dec. I'm confident they'll be worth the wait.	1
9	Loved It	I was gripped from the start. I was not expecting to enjoy this but was surprised how gripping and exciting it was. The first two seasons are better than three and four but it is still worth watching until the end. I loved the characters and even shed a tear at one point.	1
1	Very unprofessional	Come on, this is something beyond the reality. I rather prefer to watch bollywood than this stupid serie.	0
10	Money heist is amazing. Best series I have ever seen.	I love this series. I think this is the best series of all the time.	1
4	Starts as an actual crime series	Starts as an actual crime series, but swiftly changes into a Soap Opera with never ending Irrational Characters Behavior. Some LGBT / socialistic agenda here and there to get good ratings. Absolutely terrible gunfight choreography. However, maele fight choreography is even worst. Laws of physics of course do not exist. I made it to season 3 by quick forwarding second half of the show.	0
4	Then I started to question if they had trained enough	The first 3 episodes were good and then I changed my mind. If you fall in love with a hostage during a heist and you are so emotional, you are not a good robber. Ignoring RULES to protect one person is putting everyone in danger. Do your job or just kill yourself.	0
10	The Best Show On Netflix.	I am sorry but this is a top tier show. No doubt that this tops over all the hit shows! Money Heist/Lacasa De Papel is about a group that plan a massive heist against certain places or banks. The storyline is addictive you get really attached to the characters like me with Nairobi it was really sad when she died I was balling. Obviously when the show was released it wasn't given to much attention but when Netflix picked it up everyone loved it which was so admirable! Thank you for giving me the best show ever! - Tomas	1
9	1st series is the best by far	I really enjoyed the first series and didn't mind the second one. But then it just got stupid and unbelievable . PS It is way better with subtitles than dubbing!	1
1	Garbage	Eww.. I stepped in crap, Oh wait it's Money Heist.	0
1	Overrated	Overrated piece of mindless garbage deliberately created to put your braincells into a never-ending coma	0
1	Its a junk	Concept is good but the story and direction helps to ruin everything.This series should be closed within season 2. Season 3 and 4 is unnecessary.	0
10	The best series I've ever seen	The tactics are extremly good, it has a powrful message, and it has an amazing structure!. El profesor❤	1
1	Must have been directed by bollywood. Complete bs and disrespect to ones intelligence	Whats season 1 and 2 and then stop. Season 3 and 4 are an insult to your intelligence, consider yourselves warned and dont waste your time.	0
10	Outstanding!!!	Waiting for season 5. Worth to watch this fantastic webseries. Netflix keep it up	1
1	Please don't waste your time unless you enjoy Chuck Norris	Take a mastermind, the ones that could predict every move in every situation, take 12 Chuck Norris and put them on a money heist. This is what Money Hesit is, plus the robbers have cheat codes activated (infinite money and infinite ammo), and put them against the dumbest police force a kid can imagine. A total waste of time and a great offense to human intellect. If you have sympathy for thieves and robbers in genre you could enjoy this series, but if you have a decent brain, try to avoid like hell this series	0
10	LOVE ♥	I LOVE IT. THIS WAS AWESOME. THE BEST TV SERIES I'VE SEEN EVER. MUST WATCH! FROM BANGLADESH ♥	1
8	La Casa de Papel	If I die in battle, leave me here. Great story! Therefore, the state machinery serves the ruling class, and the rules are set by them.	1
3	Most over hyped and melodramatic series ever	I started watching the series as it appears on my Netflix wall as India's most watched series. Could not watch it post season 2.	0
10	Best show ever	Came in not expecting much from a netflix voice over. I was so wrong. This show is right up there if not better than breaking bad, prison break, narcos,...etc. Give it a chance just finish the first episode and I guarantee you'll be hooked	1
10	The WAR has started!!!	Thumbs up if you watch Season 3 finale shaking in your seat! Wow!! Well done! The professor met his match!	1
10	Amazing and Original	I loved this show so much. It was the first non English show I watched and was amazing there is nothing like this. If your not Spanish I recommend not watching it with English dub because it's not good at all so watch it in Spanish with English subtitles. Other than that it's AMAZING INCRÍBLE.	1
10	Hooked	I'm extremely impressed with the plot and cliffhangers that occur every episode. Starting Part 3 now and haven't lost interest. Amazing producing.	1
10	Best freaking show ever	I loveee this show, it's been a while since I've watched something this good, but la casa de papel has done it. The actors are mind blowing, I just can't get enough words to describe how good the show is. You should 100% watch it.	1
9	One of the Best show i have ever seen.	I create Imdb account only for La casa de papel rating. If you not watch it then you missed so much in his life. Just go and watch now dont waste time. I watch it 100th of times.	1
10	Bravo!	I just finished season 3 and I'm amazed at how good this show is! Must watch!	1
10	GREAT	Donting robbery every season, the tightening. A great PARTISAN series	1
10	This Series Tops my List	From their City Names to trying to save each and everyone's life, every frame is thought into very detail. The Professor Character is very Strong , even the women characters right from the scratch to very end... They devoloped thier characters very well... And Andres de Fonollosa aka Berlin is the best... The way professor plays the game with police is Mind Blowing... Gripping, Thrilling, Everything fits into this Series... 10/10	1
10	Must watch	Juat the most practical series i have ever watched Kudos to the direction	1
2	A very good story with a very very weak execution	When i stared La casa de Papel I thought it was going to be such an incredible great show but i found out really stupid show with a lot of plotholes and some stupid love stories , this show really doesn't make any sense at all.	0
10	awsome	Its very nice but Berlin died i dont exaggerate, the series is wonderful and i have never seen such a good series so far	1
10	Congrats	This is an amazing and exciting series. It's wonderful to see the actors playing so well. I love heist and robbery movies or series so I've enjoyed this one a lot. I liked even the end that in a lot of series the wordt part is the end bcause they don't know how to end it.	1
8	Must see!	This is the best show I've seen lately. Good unpredictable storyline, great actors, plot twist,excitment, action, in one word - masterpiece. You will enjoy in every minute of this show.	1
10	One of the best TV Series ever made	Yes it ranks high up at the same level as Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones. It's gripping and doesn't let you down for one second from beginning to end. I was sad to see it end. They say there might be a sequel in 2019. Let's see. One thing I found disturbing is that IMDB had no timely updates and reviews! Why is that? It's one of the most acclaimed TV series internationally. Even until today, not all episodes are registered adequately. Please fix that for the records.	1
8	So there's gonna be a season 3!	Despite some of the more ridiculous contrivances, I appreciate how suspenseful and entertaining this series can be, and being able to keep that up through the series as well as La Casa de Papel is a great feat.	1
8	This TV- Series is a wonder of marketing	This series has a very high tempo. Pedro Alonso's acting is very successful. I like this series. After watching, you will love Spanish.	1
10	Never before.	You start watching and you would want to finish the show ASAP, but once finished you will surely want more episodes. Good casting, great job. Love from india. Ha casa de papel.	1
9	Almost Surprising Over Two Seasons	It's a very surprising TV show because at the beginning you can't imagine that the bank robbery will be over two seasons. Every series is enjoyable with a cliffhanger at the end. The story isn't predictable and that is fascinating. I think at the end the story is a little bit drawn-out. The TV show should be shorter to make it perfect. Overall I think it is a hilarious TV show.	1
10	loved it	Many people has many reviews i have my own . HEIST was excuted very well .I must its far more better dan any other heist i have ever seen . thank you so much for this wonderfull story i involed myself in evry which way with this story	1
10	Can't stop watching show	One of the most addictive shows on Netflix. Script and acting are impressive.	1
10	Masterpiece!	Briliant work by everyone who is in this series! I can't get enough! I give them all the awards! O bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao!	1
10	Phenomenal	Most amazing, exciting and gripping rolar coaster of a money heist ever. My favourite programme and the best I've ever watched. Even repeated the whole thing, just can't get over how good it was!	1
9	One of The best series ever	It has all the ingredientes a powerfull unique serie must have.i just couldn't Stop watching.	1
10	- MASTERPIECE -	"Its is a combination of two (favourites) series. The ''Prison Break'' and the ''How To Get Away With Murder''. I strongly recomment '' La Casa De Papel '' because I believe that it has a lot of things to say, and it is not about '' a simple robbery ''.

*Sorry about my grammatical errors!"	1
10	Wooooooowwwww	Am amazed!!! What a series!! Just wooooow perfecto	1
10	Best tv show I ever watched	Just that. Best series ever, recommended to everyone, you won't regret it!	1
9	I love this series	La Casa de Papel is my favorite serie from Netflix. Congrats for all the good work!	1
9	I love this series	La Casa de Papel is my favorite serie from Netflix. Congrats for all the good work.	1
10	Excelent!	I watched it with my husband and we love it! We saw in Spanish and the only problem was the accent, very different from the one that we are familiar as we live in Chile. Waiting for the third season!!	1
10	Woooow	This i what i call. A damn good tv series ............ xxxxxxxx	1
10	It's a show guys c'mon!	So many whining about plot, blabla. It's a show, it's fast, funny and well acted. I really enjoyed this one and found it one of the best series i have seen. If you cannot watch tv without doubting every single piece of the script, why watching tv anyway? It's entertainment, what do you expect? Go watch discovery or something.	1
9	Wow!	Eine tolle Geschichte! Unterhaltsam, dynamisch und schön.	1
10	fabtastic	It's just a fantastic work .. i'll wait the third season to see it .. really the best work coming after the best for ever Game of thrones .. really nice work netflix wish u the best for ever	1
9	Almodovar meets Guy Gitchie	Video clip artistically, Mamet script and a huge critic of Europe's financial crisis wrapped in a series about a heist of a robbery! Great acting by many!	1
10	Good tv show	A very good tv show that keep you in the front of screen from the beginning to the end	1
10	Can't find the words to describe this show...... MIND BLOWING !	Absolutely amazing series......looking forward for season 3.	1
10	Suburb. 9 Oscars at least.	"Actors have played an excellent role. especially Berlin. He has given the serie a special touch. Let him please return in season 2. That he is dead is not really sure yet. Doors can still be open to his return. The story is simply good and exciting. If you start with the serie you want to finish the complete story in 1 time.

Hats off for the Spaniards. Excellent work."	1
10	Phenomenon!	The best tv series I've ever seen. The action and special effects cause the goose bumps non stop.	1
10	Phenomenal Find	Haven't stopped watching it for 2 days straight. I accidentally stumbled upon it trying to see if Westworld was on Netflix and let me just say I'm so glad it wasn't.	1
10	Absolut masterpiece!!	It was a bit getting used to to watch a Tv show that was spoken in Spanish but after a few episodes you are hooked and can't stop watching!!	1
10	Amazing!!!!	I almost didnt watch it deu to the language! So glad i did! Perfect tv show!	1
8	A masterpiece	The series is enormously exciting! Perfect cliffhangers. I watched it within the blink of an eye. Although, the conversations between the characters, which are in love, seem to repeat over and over again, which is - sorry 'bout that - quite annoying. It's therefore the only negative aspect, I can report. The rest is purely fantastic: The idea, the acting, the directing, the visualization...	1
10	Wonderful	I will keep this short but i made an account on imdb just so i can review this series. Truly amazing. So nerve wrecking that i found myself biting my nails through most episodes. A must see. Bella ciao :)	1
9	Thrilling and entertaining , as it should be	Sorry to disappoint some, but I am not sponsored by Netflix (maybe the will now ?). I have found he series to be absolutely thrilling and entertaining. With a cleverly built script that gives you the adequate dose of new pieces of the plan every chapter and while keeps it being coherent. Not a 10 to me because I found the love affairs and 'political' parallel threads too predictable. But it still is truly entertaining!	1
9	Intense!!	Extremely intense show, will keep you on edge for that next episode. All actors are fully immersed into character, some you would hate and that's the beauty of a great actor, some you would sympathize with. The plot is just some robbery but the way it has been portrayed, played, written and directed will simply blow your mind. The series deserves a 9/10.	1
9	Unexpectedly fantastic	"I made an IMDB account just to review this show. An exciting, action packed, nail biting thriller, with juicy twists and turns throughout the plot. Was not expecting such an addictive show from the outset. This show is definitely best watched in original Spanish. It has incredible character diversity, depth and development, with the casting being spot on. Critiques in an excellent manner the over-arching divide between the people and authority, and what drives people to take certain actions. If you want a tv series that you can't stop watching, this it. You won't regret it

Bella ciao, ciao, ciao!"	1
10	It took me	What got me in the first time. Most people spend a lifetime to have a good payed job. So what about a half year to spend on the perfect robbery to make millions. After I have seen the 1'st I couldn't stop. I only stopped because I didn't want it to end.	1
10	Mind blown.	I hope this gets more attention, as it definitely deserves it. I admit there was some cliché and a couple of plot holes (shoot the tired, and aim before you shoot.) but i feel like everything that happends in the show is so masterfully woven into the plot that it all just comes together as a masterpiece. Not only is the show (actors, plot , writing and setup) perfect, but the philosophy behind the show is also so thought provoking.	1
10	Excelente	No puedes dejar de verla, capitulo tras capitulo y no paras.Totalmente recomedada!	1
1	Lmao	It's one big Antifa circle jerk. 😂 wtf, hilarious subversion of expectations. The professor is the resistance. How pathetic.	0
10	A Phenomenom!	There's no other production like this. Thrill and drama for days. Despite of being based on a criminal action already done so many times before, this TV serie is unique. No wonder why it became a worldwide phenomenom!	1
1	Not Good at all	There was nothing new in this series, the idea is old , its like a mix between tow show (Prison break + inside man)	0
1	Free Palestine	Free Palestine,free Palestine,free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸 #free-Palestine.	0
10	Best series I ever seen!	I saw prison break, breaking bad, dark, Lucifer but money heist is the best 👑	1
10	Masterpiece	Love it. Waited for part 4 and watched it in one go	1
3	Don't waste your time on S3! Grosss!!!	Season three is Complete , I mean how could they put together all these nonsense ?!! Some dangerous known rubbers came back with the same face, same appearance, same bloody plan ... back to Europe, to Spain , go directly to National bank ?!? Without being known ?!!! Taking gold melting facilities with them inside the building !?!! And they are heroes among people?!? But why ?!? It's just GROSS!!!!!! Their speeches about love and humanity disgusts me ... for f..k sake this is supposed to be entertaining not a morality lesson !	0
10	The best today	The best you can watch today. After breaking bad for me second place in history	1
10	My opinion	Wow Wow what can I say about this creativity ... Now we can say that Season 3 is the strongest and most beautiful season in the series	1
4	Pretty bad	It's a 200 episode Tele novela compressed in 20 episodes. No logic in the action of the characters, they repeat the same cycles of mistakes they have done just an episode before. People get shot, loose a lot of blood, but in 4-5 hours they are back like nothing happened. So if you like realism, you can easily avoid this waste of time.	0
9	One of the best series out there.	Its an amazing series and a mind blowing its a masterpiece!	1
8	Ocean's eleven in twenty chapters.	"The best: The performance of all the actors, from the main ones to the occasional ones. The plot progresses continuously, there are no useless episodes for the plot. Worthy successor of the Ocean's saga.

The worst: The romantic plots obstruct the narrative. The moments that happen because the script dictates it."	1
8	OMG I'm shocked, It's a MASTERPIECE	"When my friend told me about this TV show, I was like eeeh I won't watch it because the story didn't impress me .. But I changed my opinion later after watching the trailer and also because I wanna learn Spanish. After finishing the two seasons, I can say that It's one of the best series that I have seen lately without any doubt. I loved the characters especially '' Berlin + El Profesor + Nairobi "" but Berlin was very special, It's like watching the Spanish version of Joker. You guys should watch it, You won't regret."	1
1	Gay scene in the last episode	Was that gay kissing between Berlin and Palermo in the last episode of season 4 really necessary??? I stopped watching because of that!	0

1	Killer support..free palestine	The actors must take 0/10 They support who kills innocent childs in palestine..where is their humanity??	0
10	Best	Best in world series. Most awaited series for 2021 Story writing best and.	1
10	Bang on	Very good series... Not boring fully engaged.. Proper placement of character... Character development over the season is beautifully written..... It's not overrated it deserved it.	1
1	Unprofessional	A very weak story with tons of mistakes and confusing decisions. The acting is on basic drama school level. Waste of time.	0
9	I don't get the hype	Everyone is recommending this TV show saying it is a masterpiece. I don't understand why. This is a TV show that you watch if there isn't anything else on Netflix. I got super bored, skipped some scenes, it is foolish and a super waste of time... I am watching Season 2 now hopefully it will get better.	1
3	Most boring series I've ever seen.	I don't get this hype. When I watched the first few episodes of S1 I found it amazing. One season would have been enough for this series, but as S2 started you could feel that soap opera vibe it had. It was absoluetly unrealistic and over dramatized. They should've ended after 2 seasons. S3 and S4 is just boring and unnecessary and as I said it's just a big soap opera. Painful to watch.	0
8	On the Money	"Really enjoyed Series 1 which was believable and with very likeable characters

Series two not so riveting though after a slow start warmed up"	1
1	Too much overrated	This show is just about creating non-sense, irrational and dumb sequences for desparately bringing up nail biting situations. Exaggerating so called emotions and feelings of the characters, the story fails to land in all of the episodes. A Topsy-Turvy tale which is too slow to digest and unnecessarily hyped.	0
10	Amazing	Enjoyed viewing . waiting for new season. Binge watching series	1
10	Best TV shows along with Breaking Bad...	Best La Puta Madre.. that's all I can say.. make me wanna give a slap in my face for snoring during Mrs. Martinez's Spanish in my high school year. Professor and Berlin were the best characters in the show but other supporting casts are just terrific.. Spain at its best... Viva Espana..	1
10	Wonderful, amazing, sensational series.	This is my favourite series ever. I have never been so enthralled by a TV series. I watched it with really poor English subtitles, yet that didn't detract from this incredible show. Like the crime itself, the series has been beautifully crafted; a work of genius. Nothing compares...	1
10	Best ever!	Best that I saw!!!! You should to see it, you will feel everything that you will see in this series. In couple days I saw 2 seasons and I hope it's not will end. Love it! Recommending	1
10	Fantastic series for love and money	"One of the best series I have watched since Narcos and GOT. I must say it gets very interesting as you start knowing each character.

I'm sure you would finish all 4 seasons within 10 days you start watching it"	1
1	Another level of stupidity	It is filmed as a high quality tv show, but the plot, the acting, the dialogues... it is just stupid and annoying.	0
10	Waiting for season 5	Superb...... Professor naild it again. I love all the cast of these show.	1
10	EPIC	This is an epic series. Ever. From drama and all the genres. Now I want to travel to Lisbon and Nairobi! Moscow and Denver! Tokyo and Rio! Helsinki! Berlin! Philippines is the the best though. 😊	1
10	Amazing	Great season 1 and 2 will keep you at the edge of ur seat through out the whole show. It's a great show to watch if your looking for something to do to pass time great 40 min episodes which don't fail to entertain. Season 3 might not be asss good as the rest however it could possibly have potential to carry on as good as the previous ones	1
10	Idealistic and humorous	This serie breaks the norms, and make humour about this at the same time. Like a person tha has self-sarcasm, something that shows logical and emotional intelligence. Very good actors, suspense, nice plot - not always realistic, but carries a strong message. And of course, love... 10/10 for me.	1
10	La Casa de papel	When we will be able to watch all episodes of season 3?	1
10	Exciting	I like it ifi ifi 9gifts ifif ufi gif igivifysugig8g8f8g9g	1
10	Fantabolous.	I would take a bow to the person who thought of this story! This is a brilliant series, you will not be able to think what next is coming. One of the best series in the world.	1
10	Excellent Spanish drama - great cast & story. Pure escapism!	Great drama with a mix of humour, action and suspense. Hooked from the start and loved both Part 1 & 2 .. very binge worthy :) This has introduced me to Spanish culture and a cast of who are super sexy and great character actors. Left me wanting more ... can't wait for the much rumoured Season / Part 3. Bravo!	1
10	The best 15 episodes of pure awesomeness!!!	I have become a great fan of the show creators and actors this is the best deserves whatever award that is available in this planet.	1
10	Bella ciao	"One of the most amazing series of the last years. Everything begins with ""the professor"" and everything ends with him. Every character is unique ,intersting plot every episode just amazing. The first impression is that the serie is about a robbery but la casa de papel is more than that, you will feel it from the first minutes."	1
10	One of the best	Lucid, simple, honest, intilegent!!! It has some weak moment, but in all amazing TV show!! I bet u will admire the guy who wrote screenplay he needs an award! Actors are fantastic, the professor and Berlin still the show!	1
1	The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly	"Any reviews above a 4 are fraud/paid for. The Good - the plot The Bad - most of the acting The Ugly - the script and the story flaws

What a waste!!!!"	0
10	El casa de papel	Masterfully...the cast...the screenplay...the plot..!!!	1
10	The best that Spain has had in recent years after Barca & RM !	Watched 8 episodes yet but took only 8 hours. Couldnt stop watching with all twisted episode ends. Intro video and music amazing. Directing and acting is fine. (Im not used to Spanish show, so.) Story keeps getting you everytime with every new information.	1
4	Cliché series that can't make up its mind	I don't know where to start. Really. I guess it's supposed to be a mix between crime and comedy which doesn't work at all, 'cause this series tries to be a bit of everything. At times it even tries to go deeper into the relationships between the hijackers, but it's all very cliché. The characters are very one-dimensional. And the story just drags on and on without something happening.	0
10	El brillante	"Dali masks, Red overalls, Ciao bella, revolution .. I have a lot of to say but my english is not enough for that . :) At least i can say that "" it will be worth watching this awesome TV series "". Greet with my respect !!"	1
10	word isn't enough	Best tv show ever even my favorites Game of Thronas and Breaking Bad	1

10	Worth watching	The series overall is a really good one. I enjoyed watching the 1st 2 seasons more its not like next 3 seasons were bad but the royalmint bank heist was much better!	1
10	Amazing	Part 5 is by far my favourite season of any show. It is the most exciting and exhilarating action filled series. If you don't like the previous seasons give part 5 a try, I promise you'll love it. And if you loved the previous seasons, it will amaze you even more. Part 5 is much better than anyone expected.	1
1	Not the pinnacle of spanish tv	How people compare this to classics as the best series ever is beyond me.	0
1	Bad	Bad i didn't like it so ba I hope they will work more in their project to.	0
1	All the good actors die	"The storyline on season 5 has been a little bit boring and frankly not interesting at all . Why are all the good actors must die??! And the action is stupid .

I won't watch the next seasons ."	0
10	Good plot and storylines	The best season. Hopefully wont disappoint for the next part.	1
10	Finally it's back : )	"I've waited for the return of the show and here it so. I'm ready to see what they do next. I'm hoping that they get to live in the real world and still continue to pull of money heists.

I do hate that some of the good players in the game are killed off. Or jus t maybe they aren't?????

In any regard, I love the show and I'm ready for the return & it's finally back!!"	1
10	Mind blowing Stroy	Its a Great Series. I seen Ever Before. Lots Of love for professor.	1
1	Good tv series	I think this is lazy tv series but this is not bad .	0
1	Great story line with the worst direction and acting!	I tried! I really tried to like it. Great story line with the worst direction and acting I've ever seen. The high ratings must be paid ratings.	0
2	A soap opera under heist genre	"I love heist movies/series. But this is not one. The more you watch, the more you get annoyed. You can hope the characters to behave sensibly eventually, but that doesn't happen.

Stupid criminals loving criminals, hostages loving criminals, police loving police, criminal loving police, hostage loving hostages. Every stupid love combination. That too in a heist that supposed to be planned enough.

The worst part is the plot holes. All criminals gathering together too often only to leave the hostages alone long enough to plan escapes.

Don't waste time over this, instead just rewatch your favorite movie."	0
10	Best	Best series in world 🌍 Very very very nice series Best rating in professor.	1
1	Stupid in the extreme	Utterly moronic from start to finish. Very few words can convey how stupid, unrealistic and completely moronic this show is. I actually started laughing midway through when a robber managed to get back into the bank.	0
9	Almost perfect	Season 2 kinda had the downward spiral, but in season 3 it jumped right back up.	1
10	the best tv show i ever seen, please watch it.	The best tv show i ever seen. I swear. It's literally masterpiece, the cast are amazing and the story in this show is wow.	1
4	Just bad	From the first episode I was pretty impressed, but then I found out it was just a mediocre soap opera. The story makes zero sense, third and fourth season are rubbish.	0
10	Intelligence	"Mastermind game, intelligence at top level.

I have watched so many web series but this is awesome and cool."	1
10	Mind blowing movie	Dramatic series good story we can travel without any lag in movie	1
1	Opposite of Pulp Fiction	This series, obviously created for the adolescent market yet without so saying, drags one through everything but the points, so tedious and boring as it is. Skip this one folks. I'm sure they've already duped or scooped enough dinero to pay this cast.	0
10	The best series ever made .💯💯	"This series is far better than any other series or movies . If you ever get a chance to watch this then never lose that time . This series is worth watching . The best series ever seen 👏.

I would request all to see it because it has the best characters related to our lives .

And believe me you will love it .

And this will become your favourite also .. you can bet on it .😎😍"	1
4	Intriguing but painfully stupid	I'm 4 episodes in and I'm liking it so far but half of the important characters lack any logic or reasoning. One of the two characters I like is Berlin, mainly because he teaches these imbeciles a lesson for being being behind the IQ curve but even he can be dumb sometimes, however, to a lesser degree. Hopefully, it will get better as it goes on but these 3 to 4 star reviews I'm seeing aren't giving me much hope.	0
2	Just don't...	I will be short. If you want to watch a great series, just watch the first and the second season, don't continue after that. The second season has a great finale and all after that is not worth even 1 from 10, it becomes classic Latin American telenovela.	0
2	Cheap copy of Inside Man.	I agree to lot of reviews that is really a soap opera and you can feel that the producers have tried to adapt the plot from movie Inside Man (great movie) in my opinion which made even more worse. And a lot of characters were really annoying in this heist show, so I was just switching off the show, especially when the singing started :D	0
10	Umm.. The episode list in season 1	Am I wrong or the season 1 only has 9 episode listed but it has in real 13 episodes	1
1	Don't waste time	What the actual hell is going on? I had such high hopes for this show, it started off so SO good, but then after 6th or 7th episode of the very first season it just went downhill. Like many have already said, it turned into a very long soap opera that has very little to do with the heist. So much stuff just doesn't make sense anymore. It would have been so much better if they just created one season.	0
10	An amazing watch	"Liked A-Z in the movie. Love tracks, mystery, mannerisms, planning, direction, suspense..... Everything is superb.

Eagerly waiting for the 5th season"	1
10	MAZZEDAR	LOCKDOWN MAI BEST TIMEPASS SUSPENSE AND THRILLER MAKE THIS SERIES BEST ONE	1
10	It's just stunning	There is not a single episode which i have not enjoyed dude everything is just stunning. I have watched many series but yarim kalan asklar and money heist are just incredible	1
1	The most overrated series in the world and in the history of mankind.	The series literally fools the audience openly with a story that makes no sense at all, common sense is abandoned and doesn't even need a brain to watch it. Now I know why even Spaniards don't like this series, it's rubbish. only third world countries love this series with their third world sensation. I don't wonder why the ratings are high, third world people really like this kind of trash.	0
10	Amazing mann	I don't know why people hate this series. When I started it watching I was so much addicted that I do nothing except waching it. It has some small elements that are simply outstanding like oragami, professor clothes and even the story itself is a masterpiece. They name everything upon city. Go and watch it right away.	1
10	Very unique series with even better plot twists	I could not stop watching this series when I first found out about it, it had me so intrigued from the very start. The music in it is awesome and the song Bella caioa being so iconic fits this heist series very nicely. Truly a very iconic series with a great cast.	1
1	Overrated	I don't like, its getting bore in every episodes, and one of the overrated series, dubbing is absolutely rubbish.	0
10	Perfect series	This is an amazing series, the cast of each character is simply phenomenal. Just loved it.	1
10	FAVORITE!	I'm really love this show and can't wait for new season! I love Spanish movies and shows in general. They really make good stories that you never can guess how it will end. So does this one! Very very good and definitely one of my apsolute favorites!	1
10	Phenomenon	This show had a documentary made about it for a reason. It is a jaw dropping, literal heart stopping show that makes you fall in love with each character, despite knowing that the show could kill them at any point in time. This is a classic robbery show twisted, where the robbers are the 'good guys' and the police are the bad ones. The acting is amazing, and being set in Spain this show is ever more gorgeous. I just don't know what to say. Watch it. That's all. Just watch it.	1
10	extraordinary	Nothing to say,, it's a master piece love it.Please make this type of series . it's really a extraordinary series .?	1
9	Masterpiece	This show is a masterpiece. Especially the first two seasons are amazing. Must watch! Worth watching it.	1
8	A great 2-season show	Money heist started a magnificent idea in the first season and brilliantly put and end to it in the second one. And then came Netflix to ruin everything. I mean, what on earth is this?! Are you kidding me?! Seasons 3 and 4 were absolute garbage. The only positive thing was season 3 finale and even that was against a lot of the show's own logic. Seriously, what they did to the show was so cruel. If it wasn't for this final disasters I would have rated it higher than 8.	1
8	Good Series on Money Heist!	This is really a good series for heists.Although there are some huge mistakes in the series where the professor's plan could have been failed for sure.But overall execution of drama is great!	1
10	please dont finish this series	Please don't finish this series at season5 :) money heist is best series and i need to watch it :( please check my review :) i need you	1
8	Gripping	I'm surprised by the latest reviews on here. Money Heist is very watchable with excellent actors. There is much pathos although a little overdone and the numerous flashbacks are a pain as they interrupt the action unnecessarily. Of course it's far fetched but would you rather watch a film of someone mowing their lawn? I for one am looking forward to part 5.	1
8	Not too bad a show	Despite all the negative reviews here for season 3 &4, despite some of the stupid people or plots out there, the storyline is complete and is attractive. I got obsessed with the professor's whole plans, which is amazing. Looking forward already to season 5 or more.	1
1	Most dissapointing endending ever (season 2)	"I don't even bothered to watch the 3rd season. The end of the 2nd season was a total nonsense: ""I no longer know who are the bad guys"". Maybe the ones that are robbing the factory? The end was so dissapointing not to mention the whole actions of police. They actually did nothing! They even got the name of a profesor but no one even bothered to look for him! And the main inspector character... Felt like a dissgrace for a woman... She literally did nothing to free hostages or capture the robbers. Uch so much wasted time..."	0
10	10/10	My all time favourite..full stop..Nairobi will be missed..	1
1	Sucks 3 and 4 season	Should have stopped from 2nd season,No logic.	0
10	Awesome series	This is one of the most addictive season. Great characters and interesting story.	1
10	Must Watch	I think it is one of the best web series ever. All the characters were did their best for making this masterpiece. Must watch web series	1
4	Amateur Hiest show.	It's like Ekta Kapoor's Ocean's Eleven. Go watch something better if you're even planning on watching this dumb show.	0
1	Total misunderstood by the title	It's a drama Like me who are for some good thriller or heists things keep away from it	0
10	What a master plan	Story telling is one of best part of this series. The director of this series doing great. As an movie and series lover I must say, this series is really awesome. In every season enjoy a lot. Wait for next season of this series. The Professor just mind blowing. Even, every corrector is really too good. Just love it.	1
10	BRAVO	Brilliant idea, well made, good actors, you won't get sleep during these series, Thank you for such a good entertainment!! there always will be people who won't like masterpiece. Bravo!	1
10	Blowing mind!!	Woow!! Amazing movie I love all the detial of the story, Berlin, he is such an brilliant, charismatic, and intelligent I can't sleep waiting next season	1
9	A little badder than 3 but ...	It was good season they changed the pace of it characters got more aggresive towards hostages and hostages have almost no effect on the heist and we cant connect with them like season 1 n 2 and its not as hype and suprising as season 1 n 2 and character building is a bit weak on this season but overall its much better than season 3 and its not that bad to have a aggresive season	1
10	Just wonderful	No words to say...Highly recommended and superb.Climax at it's very best	1
10	Waata Series	I luv it. Waat a screen play and BGM.Each and every screen will make yu sit in the edge of the seat.	1
9	best	"I made an account for put my rate in this movie. I love how they make season one two, three, and four but honestly, season 4 is not as good as 3 seasons before. Overall, I love this series, much. You make us listen ""bella ciao"" from over the world :). Thank you for all the cast, crew, and everyone behind this series. Thanks to Netflix ofc.

#lovefrom Indonesia"	1
10	Money Heist = OUTSTANDING	"Just finished watching season 2. Yes, it may be a little late compared to many of you.

I have only one word to say ""Wow, what is this""? It's that good and full of thrills. Every character is so powerful, but Professor has taken this series to the next level. Hats off!

It's a Must Watch!"	1
4	Boring	The idea of the series is good, but the crew is made of amateurs. They have no guts and they are not even able to shoot someone.	0
9	Keeps you Interested	The logic explained and thrilling moments of the heist keeps you at the edge of your seat.	1
4	Money heist	Bank scene absolutely show cling how they treated people what was the writer and director thinking to make people so scared instead of just robbing the bank.	0
10	Salute! For masterfully heisting our precious time	"Brilliant, Masterpiece Fast, on the edge thrill & game of twists after twist, season 4 aced all the others. History in the making. People going to talk about for it many years. Haven't seen such series after Breaking Bad.

Salute to all the series makers for masterfully heisting our precious time"	1
10	The best show in 2020 so far	The best show specially I liked the reckless smiling and stable of Berlin.	1
10	Best show I Have ever seen. Much love to the team <3	This is the show you can't miss to see. Every second of this show is worth watching. This can be your best addiction. You won't regret watching it ever. Waiting for the next episode/season! Completed the 4th season too.	1
3	This heist should be wrapped up in one season	"Inane plot line, robbers falling in love with hostages and I was fuming when watching the last episode of season one that mint robbery would not end.

Who makes a show about a robbery that lasts three seasons? This is soap opera.

I can't believe I wasted 13 hours watching the first season. I liked it alright. But if you can't wrap up a robbery in one season don't make a series.

My recommendation, save your time and don't watch this endless PAP."	0
10	Outstanding	Money Heist Is on of the best web series i have ever seen.	1
8	Excepcional!	With nice artistic choices, a smart storie and charismatic characters, La Casa de Papel os one of the best things you will find in series! However, the show still have problems, especially in the second season and the end of first season: plot holes and conveniences, besides drama bad posicioneded make the show less then it could be; however this doesn't mean a terribly thing, just are mistakes that most public will barely notice. In the end this serie still one of the best and you really should watch this now!	1
10	Must match is best of all	Best TV serial so far I have seen game of thrones and many more it's gonna be legendary ! 😃	1
9	Masterpiece	Probably the only thing better than breaking bad, highly recommend watching	1
10	Awesome best genius mindblowing	Awesome direction awesome show. Not a single second is boring this deserves 10/10	1
10	best tv series yet on netflix so far but....	This is the best series i have watched on Netflix so far. all the drama, acting dialogues are written so well. just disappointed with on script where they habe to hire Pakistani hackers. seriously ??? Pakistan is not that good. there GDP is so poor. it could be any asian country like china japan korea etc. but why they have to take Pakistan name? so made at this.	1
10	Addicted and highly recommend	Started watching this last week and now I cannot stop! Full of drama, great story line and it's always intense before an episode end	1
9	A masterpice!	"I love it omen of the best shows right now on Netflix !

And give that man pedro alonso WHO plays Berlin a Emmy damm hes good"	1
9	Ignore the 1 star ratings	A lot of people say you must be braindead to like this series but i think you must be braindead not to feel anything watching this series. No, it's not perfect, has minor plot flaws, yes, some characters are acting idiotic sometimes but overall it's enjoyable. Anyways, watch it and make up your own mind, just don't listen to all the haters pretending to be professional critics whom i believe couldn't even write a two page essay.	1
10	The best !	Can't stop watching! Exciting and educational. Love the Spanish environment of the scene. Good to great.	1
10	Amazing!	Probably one of the best things I've ever watched! Clever, full of suspense & great acting! Superb! Can't wait for Season 3!!	1
10	The best serial ever!	This is the best serial ever made! I can not believe how man can insparation for something like this. Every second of serial is excitinig, interesting and strong. I do recomande this! My favourite så far!	1
10	The best series ever!!!	It's different and it's revolutionary. Bella Ciao!!	1
10	One of the best tv shows in the last 10 years	This tv show is intense, brilliant, well written. Must watch!	1
10	The best thing since prison break.....	Money heist is a must see, once you start you're hooked. This can't be missed.	1
1	9 star to 1 star	First two seasons deserve 9 stars and the next three seasons deserve 5 or 6 stars at best but giving 1 star because Netflix milking a hit series as long as it can almost 30 episodes for the second heist and still continues they added sooo much filler content its getting boring.	0
10	One of the amazing show ever i watched	This show is super crazy and it has every minute details in it and the characters are out of this world.	1
9	Good	I think this season was good. But ,the writers could have add more main story.as you can saw in this season,the flashback scene was more and the main scene was less. I hope the next part of this season will have a good ending,and also good story.	1
1	#BoyocottLaCasaDepPapel	FreePalestine. 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸	0
2	Season 5 biggest disappointment ever	I'm so angry and sad for this series, it could be one of the greatest of all time, and instead it became classic Spanish soap telenovela. First season was mind-blowing, second was also great, third became average, while forth and fifth were big disappointments. I'm sad that creators had more desire for money than to end it in proper way for fans. No new ideas, telling already told stories, action scenes persists only with gun machines and grenades, big logic mistakes. If I could, I would give a zero grade.	0
1	For Palestine✌	"For Palestine and because of the crimes of the Israeli occupying i am giving this bad rate.

Before supporting this criminals try to know what they did and still doing in Palestine 🇵🇸"	0
2	Just watch 1st and 2nd season.	It was my favourite show till season 5 came out. It didn't meet even a single expectation. Season 5 the worst season ever. They say breakup heart the most but it's actually seeing your favourite things getting destroyed infront of you and you couldn't do a single thing. They killed the show. Before this season i had given it 10/10 but now it's just disappointing.	0

10	Nairobi FOR LIFE	Love the series, each character is special, relatable and driven in their own way, it's amazing. Ohh and Nairobi is a GODDESS.	1
1	Palestine	It will always be Palestine.however they try. God with Palestine they don't need anyone.	0
1	Waste of time	Season 1-2 very good season 3-5 is really really bad.	0
1	Overhyped nonsense!	"Season 1 is a good one time watch. Rest all seasons are overhyped with no sense in storyline.

Stay away from this unless you want to waste time."	0
2	Not recommended	It would be good if they had stopped after 2nd season The show's getting cringy every season.	0
4	...why	At the beginning the show was a 10/10 as more seasons came out it rapidly decreased to a 4/10 disappointed.	0
4	After two season catastrophic!!	"First and second seasson were great, but after is was really catastrophic!! The gun actions was unbelievable bad, it insults your intellect because the concept of this Series was on details.

The season 5 - ZERO points!!"	0
2	Netflix are you still watching?	Are you still watching ... Click no and switch the tv off .. Thank Me later.	0
10	Artist	Best série 4 ever hhhhh 4 Hollywood La casa del papel.	1
8	it is not perfect	I adore the first season of the show. The second one had some plot holes but was still really good and we should have stopped there. If you just started with the show dont watch parts 3 and 4 just stop on the second one and dont ruin the show for yourself.	1
8	Macarena	Hi how are u i dont wht shoud i write hetr exactly	1
8	Season 4 blahh	Watching season 1 and 2 have 10 stars . watching season 4 taking back my two stars . Season 4 was worthless too many mistake .guard got more role then main character ...	1
9	The rise , the fall	The first 2 seasons are some of the greatest seasons of tv history and they deserve to be watched and loved. But the latter 2 seasons are just a copy of the first 2 but in a bigger and badder way but bigger doesn't always mean better in this case the lack of some characters and things like palermo supporting the plan but then destroying it makes it silly and illogical.	1
10	Watch this before anything !	Bro I just fall in love with this series, man Damm this is the series, which kept all of us with their true emotions and feeling , watch this I recommend you all, have a nice day	1
4	A bunch of emotional characters.	It was fine and then not long after its not. Dumb, emotional, immature characters. It should have ended after the first heist.	0
9	Masterpiece	Very interesting story..loved it..full of action..and the story looks like real cause the way they fight themselves in heist.. sometimes they fail the police won but sometime they won..very good till season 2..season 3 and 4 is awkward weird..but still entertaining <3 And yes this a part of plan	1
9	Absolutely incredible!	Incredible! Extremely imaginative and original, as well as intelligently crafted and suspenseful. The characters are are also fantastic. Was a little weird that it's dubbed over because it's Spanish but you get use that pretty quickly! Super fun likeable characters with lots of twists and turns. Definitely recommend.	1
8	Amazing but...	The first two seasons had a proper buildup and was excellent to watch. 10/10 for the first two seasons. The next two seasons were good but had unnecessary extension of the story which I'm not a big fan of. Looking forward to season 5.	1
4	Too dragged	I am not sure at all whats all the hype about. It is too dragged and the direction is so boring, too much drama that doesn't even relate. I am so very confused of the ratings that it achieved on IMDB. the episodes should be of less that 30 mins and also not more than 8 in total. I have watched two seasons until now and now I am sure not wasting my time anymore.	0
9	One of the best	"This is one of best heist series I have ever seen. Be it Story, acting or direction, everything about this series top notch. ""The professor"" is the character like ""Heisenberg"" (Breakin bad) that knows solution to all the problems, character that you will never forget."	1
8	Netflix destroyed this series	For season 1 and 2 i'd like to rate 10/10 but season 3 and 4 was not that much impressive as expected 'd like to rate 7/10 though i liked the acting of professor Aka Alvaro morte and small cameos of Berlin aka Pedro alonso throughout.These characters never get you bored in the show.Overall would like to give 8 stars	1
8	Netflix destroyed this series	For me season 1,2 rating - 10/10 but part 3 and 4 was not that much impressive as expected would like rate 6/10 though I liked the acting of professor aka Alvaro morte and small cameos of Berlin aka Pedro Alonso.They never get you bored with their acting through out the series.	1
8	TOO LONG WE3B SERIES	WELL THE SERIES WAS GOOD TILL SEASON 2.AFTER THAT THE STORY LINE TOOK A TURN AND IT BORING.BUT I LOVED SEASON 2 AND SEASON 2, AFTER A LONG TIME GOT TO SEE SOMETHING NEW	1
9	Last Season is so clueless	Story for last season is really clueless. Expectations was quite high as the previous heist was so exciting!	1
8	It is a great series please don't be a greedy company	I don't know what to say my hopes where crashed after the showing of the last season i am sorry but it could end in season 4 and it will last as a great legend and maybe my grandsons in the future will watch it but aftr what you did in season 4 I am sure that you will lose a lot of fans if you do the same in the 5th season At last It was rated 10 by me after the 4th it goes down to 8	1
3	Overrated TV show	This TV show is overrated and the police is a huge glitch. They make police look stupid to show the audience that the other side smart. So much fake hype about this TV show.	0
10	Treat to my eyes!!!	I'm not a heist movie fan at all! But but but, I've to say that I binged watched it for 2 days! It so surprising, exciting, roller coaster ride kinda thing. I'm not a IMDb reviewer, but I had to create an account just to review this particular show.. It's absolutely a masterpiece. Must watch!!!!!!	1
9	Possibly, the best series on Netflix.	So far every episode has been great from start to finish. The acting , story, and script are impeccable and almost every Episode has some kind of twist or cliffhanger , forcing you to watch the next episode (or 10). If you're a fan of action or crime films, bank heist movies etc this is possibly one of the best ones you'll watch. Hands down. Even if it is dubbed/ subtitled	1
9	2 seasons	Very clever and interacting plot. But it should have finished in season 2. The third season is a replay of the same...	1
9	I was left astonished	"Honestly, I don't write many reviews or give many tv shows a high rating. This was hands down one of the best experiences and well thought out tv shoes I have watched in a very Long time. Besides a couple of episodes I was captivated all throughout seasons 1 and 2 the main heist. Loved the acting, loved everything.

I highly recommend you do not watch the English dub version, to get a real grip from the actors performances and tone and amazing scenes of emotion you need to watch this in its original Spanish with English subtitles"	1
9	Great heist show but I think they changed the dubbing actors	I loved this heist show, so much so that I'm watching it again with my sister. But I'm watching it again, I think some of the voiceovers have been changed. Weird if they really did. But still would recommend this to anyone.	1
10	I've seen lately it is so thrilling and ingenious plot	One of the best series I completed 3sessions in 3days this show is perfect	1
9	Plot crafting like no other	Simply put, this is one of the best crafted crime dramas I've ever seen. The characters and plot share equal importance across all three series and the timeline split, (whilst not exactly original), is perfectly crafted to create backstory as the real-time plot unfolds. Special mention also should go to the voice actors ... We watch this in the UK with English overdub and it's done so well that you actually stop noticing it... (And I say this as someone that gets annoyed when Netflix audio slips out of sync by a fraction!) Top class entertainment... We want more!	1
10	Very good serie	This is one of my favourite serie,and I recommend this for everyone.	1
8	Quite intersting...	It is bank robbery web series..really i was curious that how can make a web series for a bank robbery but as i was expected it is a linear screenplay eventhough it made me surprise first episode itself they went into bank for robbery...	1
10	One if the best tv shows ever	Everything on this show is fantastic waiting for the new season ASAP	1
9	One of the best shows on Netflix right now	Binged watched season 1 in 1 day and season 2 on 2nd . The story is gripping and the direction is superb . Watched in English but still the dubbing is good . Loved all the characters . Waiting for April now...	1
9	Gripping after the end of first season	Master piece and Gripping after the end of first season	1
9	Masterpiece	Am not here for review But to share my favt characters Professor is my favt character Berlin Second Favt Nd I hate yes i hate Tokyo She is ignorant, Annoying, Selfish Girl	1
10	Le casa de papel	The best tv show I have ever seen before cuz I felt with thim evry step .. the drama is professional and the action very legend I like it and I hope the will keep like this way	1
9	Think Ocean's 11 - but more comprehensive!	What a great ensemble. So many stories and character dynamics going on the writers somehow weave it seamlessly together and find the psychology and planning behind each heist so carefully thought out! Excellent show which I watched in Spanish AND English - such a re-watchable show! More More More!!!!	1
10	Love season 1	Might seem like a high review but let me explain, season one is amazing I was hooked from the beginning and binge watched it, the characters are phenomenal the plot is amazing but season two and three just arnt as good-they don't measure up. Season three was especially disappointing; like someone else mentioned, actors made stupid silly illogical decisions to allow the show to progress however this cheapens the fabric of the show-definitely recommend to watch non the less. bella ciao bella ciao bella ciao ciao	1
10	Best TV serie Ever !	After Prison Break, this is the Best Tv Serie which i have ever seen in my life ! Every minute you will be surprise ... and I found myself in love with Spanish ... 🇪🇸	1
10	Excellent	Excellent series ,Good Netflix flick.i have watched 2 to 3 times some good scenes,Tokyo entering back into heist......so on must watch series.	1
10	Best series ever	Don't see other review just buy netflix and watch it every episode has a great ending and it will make u curious what will be the nxt professor thinking is just above everyone thinking just go and watch	1
10	Top 10	This non Hollywood series should be in the top 10 tv shows..Non stop suspense,it will glue you to your seat throughout and wanting more..	1
10	Amazing!!!	The show is so thrilling and amazing. Full of drama and suspense with great cast and acting. Always recommended.	1
10	One and only one.	Slower start but Every character is unique and conveys a message. Must watch list. and top rated series. Finished all three seasons in 3 days and night and Already waiting for the 4th season now.....!!!!	1
9	Entertaining, gripping & fun	One of those few series which strikes the perfect balance of entertaining unexpected twists and turns with a ideological & methodical execution ! Love it	1
10	Dios mío, estoy boquiabierta, Que pedazo de obra maestra!	Criándome con pelis de Tarantino, James Cameron, Spielberg, viendo las mejores películas de la historia, series impresionantes, y me da alegría que después de haber visto tanto, todavía haya joyas que me sorprendan así, una locura, en el mejor de los sentidos, la serie más inteligente e impredecible que he visto, junto con The OA, excelente, sublime, una obra que fuma un cigarrillo debajo del agua, de lo mejor que he visto en cine/series. 10/10 y me quedo corto!	1
10	Absolutely stunning	I do not want to say much because every little detail from the episodes worth it. All I want to say is that La casa de papel is an amazing serie with excellent actors, writers and direction. Perfect! Amazing! I hope the next season is coming up soon.	1
10	The best series I've ever seen	Wonderful wonderful every word I have seen several series and films from around the world, America and many countries, but this is very wonderful and the actors were more than wonderful, including (berlin, profesor, tokyo, rio, denver, mosco, nairobi,.....) I wish you success and more success of greetings to you from Morocco	1
1	Pooooorr... I Don't get the hype	Do not waste your time in this series !! Reduntant and logicless in most parts with plotholes.	0
10	a great show	It's a great I don't expected I will watch a great series after prison break ,teen wolf and the vampire diaries it's one of the best series I have watched	1
10	Great Web Series	Excellent Web Series. Every scene is gripping. Great Story. Each and every episode has Suspense. Loved watching. Eagerly waiting for the Season 5.	1
10	Best series ever!	I actually watched the show as it was trending everywhere, but I didnot regret it. It is so damn exciting. I almost kept started stalking everyone's character on the social media. ;D And the proffeser (Alvaro Morte), hats off to him. He is the best actor I have seen till date. I almost started adapting his behaviour in my real life. Such a cute smile he hassssss. If you haven't watched the series now, I recommend you to watch, you won't regret it. I'm soooo eagerly waiting for season 5 <3	1
1	Poor story and poor acting	This is a total waste of time, and it doesnot even worth watching. Very bad writing and full of fillers, despite the good first seson but all that follows is uust rubbish and the ratings show that people didnot like the growth of the characters nor the heist storylines or dialogues. I really donot recommend it to anyone, it was a waste of time and money really.	0
3	Mediocre...	"Not as good as rating. Only ""Barlin"" is interesting. Others are boring. Prefessor and inspector has no chemistry between them. Police are too weak. Everybody is making unthinkable mistakes. Really!!!"	0
2	Amateurish and cringy	Looks good but it is not!!! Very bad script!!! If you have watched a lot of TV shows ang have high standaeds don't waste your time with this one. I cannot believe this show has higher rating than Prison Break and other much much better shows.	0
10	INCREDIBLE MINDBLOWING	This serie hooked me in the first second. I watched the second season on spanish and its reallly one of the best series i´ve watched	1
10	Original, thrilling and full of excitement	Masterpiece in every sense. Binge watched in 2 days. The show is full of ups and downs where you want the robbers to get away with it every time the police are close to catching them. The characters are all likable and getting to know each of them story and how their personality integrates in the heist is really interesting.	1
1	Chuti****ya ghatiya nonsense web series	"Lovede ka web series.

Chuti****ya ghatiya nonsense web series."	0
10	Love it	Best serial ever by Netflix. Can not wait for the fourth season.	1
10	Dare to review	Trust me if u are a true genius this show must for u unbelievable drama and dialogue.	1
10	The best series till date.	The best a series can get, be it the acting, direction, screenplay, dialogue writing, dialogue delivery anything it is the best, and clearly it is not one of the best, it is the best series, the gluing effect it has on you, the suspense and all those are just beyond anything. Do watch it.	1
10	PHENOMENAL	This is one of the best series I have ever seen in my 45 years of life. The plot, the acting, the action, the cinematography, the non-stop plot twists...I can't say enough about it. Netflix is kicking a$$ with this series as well as all of their other series from Spain.	1
10	Captivating, thrilling, what else do you need?	I won't mind admitting that this show successfully stick you to the screens of your devices. It's thrilling, every episode is bang on, hence perfect.	1
10	Americans are so jealous about a good European series	I am not saying anything bad but some people always have complaints when it doesn't belong from their country.	1
3	A festival of clichés	One of the worst Netflix productions, La Casa de Papel is a combination of lame Novelas with Steven Segal action, supported by basic cliffhangers and a remarkably good direction (my only reason for 3 stars) and cinematics (for continental Europe standards). It's a shame that this is praised as good Spanish entertainment, when Spain and Europe has so much better to offer.	0
4	HORRIBLY DONE	This is the worst production of special police forces I've ever seen. You have 50 trained officers, some are professional snipers, shooting at one criminal and none can shoot straight meanwhile the criminals throughout the entire production can shoot without shields and take down the SWAT team (sounds like they belong with the Star War's storm troopers). Yeah, that believable. No police protocol...that's another reality. Spanish police must be the dumbest cops on the entire planet. I paintball better than the police shoot.	0
1	Free Palestine	"Free Palestine from the river to the sea🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸

So disappointed.may Allah destroy Israel soon."	0
1	Free Palestine	Free Palestine. Free Palestine Free Palestine Free Palestine.	0
1	#free_palestine	The crew are zionists. It us #Palestine and it will always be and stay #Palestine ... #free_palestine.	0
4	Good if you are 13 years old	"I really and truely do not get the brilliant reviews. You really have to suspend all logic, it may as well be sci-fi.

They lock themselves away for months planning this heist...and within the first hour they have manage to let a teenage girl get access to a phone and leave people unsupervised to run around the bank. Then going soft for captives.

Just ridiculous."	0
10	Best	Best webseries I've seen so far...still I've a hangover on this series...it's close to heart... Egarly Waiting for the next season..	1
10	This is best web series ever i watch in my life	Yes ! I love this series i And I would like to say that like and web series should be made.	1
10	Amazing series	Episodes are extremely amazing with good storyline. Worth watching this series.	1
1	Unethical and overhyped	Professor is just a hype and he is not at all.smart Just people who.are dumb felt him smart and the series really broke my ethics and I was alot angry! What about the people working hard to.earn and trying to make this world a better place.	0
10	Money Heaist	This is best web series I ever watched. I am felt love with the series suspence and action scene. Thanks for this good web series.	1
10	Professor fans from India	Professor = Spectacular and what a series. You all should go and watch this......Very very good series.	1
9	Good show , I don't understand the bad reviews	It's intriguing and it forces you to keep binge watching. Even though I skipped some scenes , it's not bad at all and worth the time. I don't get why it's getting terrible reviews.	1
10	This is fantastic tv show .	This is fantastic tv show . I'm still watching this. I love this.	1
10	Insane movie	I have never seen any movie like this This is next level of imagination. 😁👍	1
10	Masterpiece ... Best webseries i've ever seen in my life	MUST MUST MUST MUST WATCH IT!! HIGHLY RECOMMONDED...I have no words to express my love for this series... We need more this type of webseries ... All seasons are blockbuster in there way... This webseries deserve Oscar ... Ealgerly wating for Season 5 👀👀💋💋💘💘❤	1
9	One of the beat web series	I love this show, one of the best web series. I love all characters of Money Heist.	1
3	It is clear to everyone - this is a soap opera	This show has some interesting moments and could have used its potential. But no...the writters decided to make another splash of soap opera and unnecessary gay scenes. I often have to use fast-forward because it's hard to do with drama, cringe and too much irrationality. Here you can see the relationship between robbers and robbers, robbers and hostages and all other possible combinations which neither makes sense nor purpose. Just another soap opera that you can only watch if you turn off your brain. It is a pity that the potential was not used.	0
9	Great show!	I absolutely love 'La casa de Papel'! It's very addictive and exciting to wacht. The story amazes you every time, the writers are insane. And finally, the cast, all amazing actors.	1
9	LA CASA DE PAPEL IS NOT ABOUT A HEIST	The ones who think that this show is about a heist have completely missed the message. This show is not about the plan itself. Teh plan is just a way to highlight the character development and share messages and ideas. There are flaws, but that's near enough to consider this a poor show.	1
4	Overrated	No action, no mystery, some kind of crime with plot holes and lot off soap opera filler.	0
2	I'd only recommend it to kids (Completely Unrealistic)	"It started well in Season 1 but come Season 2 it became a cartoon. Way too many coincidences and ""luck"" it's unrealistic. Any adult would pick out how such occurrences would almost never happen. Only a kid would enjoy such far fetched drama. Movie takes us back to the early 2000's movie where the director/writer bends & twists the movie to fit his imagination devoid of reality. I couldn't finish it as it became too detached"	0
2	Bad season 4	Should have ended in season 2. Season 4 is a fiasco. They shoot at the security guard from all four sides, but they are not shot even in the hand or leg. And other fictional nonsense. Season 4 was the last season for me. I will not follow anymore	0
3	show of nonsense	Nothing makes sense even the idea of steal a bank very silly to make a tv show about it and the dialogue between the actors very bad and i hate it even the writers have no idea and they will make a new season full of nonsense	0
10	Clever	This is like the Spanish version of Breaking Bad. And its on steroids. This is a masterpiece. Should have ended with the end of 2nd season (Netflix edition), and even though the 3rd and 4th seasons are a bit dumber, but things get VERY intense.	1
1	What a stupid movie😂😂	Bunch of stupid childish loosers, mannnn it should me comedy movie for real hahaha don't waste your time unless you like seeing dramatic kids playing around hide and seek	0
1	Yuck	I dislike every single character. None are cut out to complete their mission. They all have weak minds and the whole thing is so unrealistic it's laughable. If they had made this to be set in an alternate reality where people are stupid and the government has no power MAYBE I could stand it.	0
1	Waste of time , Too stupid and overrated	Damn 1-2 seasons pretty good , don't say the best I have denn better one , it's more like soap opera not heist , but still okey BUT 3-4 seasons it's awful , just way to earn money from overhyped series You can watch first two season and stop . So many mistakes and too much drama I can't understand people who give 10/10 , that's maximum 6/10 no more . People ready to watch any sh**t and Netflix feed people with that kind of show	0
10	10 stars only for profesor	El profesor is love. This show is hit because of him	1
10	Excellent	Excellent acting,story everything !!! Specially professor😊 dont know why some haters spreading negativity about this series well who cares ...niceee 😊	1
1	This Series proves how stupid this generation is	I stopped watching after few episodes.. But I don't know why this young generation like this so much ? All I can say is We are going towards a darker future...	0
10	You fall in love with professor	"Every single minute you just scratch your head that how's this possible , but then professor play the role perfectly and trust me you love itt first 3 episode quite slow but the on 4 episode you just feel like complete the whole 4 season!!

Every character is so perfect you just love itt"	1
10	Most underrated	This series was the far best series I've ever seen. It carries lots of messages, the plot is excellent, yeah there are some mistakes, but these are just slight mistakes. It was exciting and it was a critic of our modern world. The actors and actresses are fantastic except for Tokyo, I didn't like her, but the rest of them are amazing. Every season was amazing.	1
10	The Best 😍	The Best 😍 The Best 😍 The Best 😍 The Best 😍 The Best 😍	1
10	Truly a Big Fan of the series	Amazing... 4 season was boom boom. Truly become a big fan of the series. Waiting for 5 season. Must watch.	1
10	An ironic robbery!! El Professor!!!!❤	Give this a damn chance and from the 1st episode this will keep you excited and trilled. Whatever happens each and evry episode brings a new twist in the story!!! And as always each season has meaningful and worthful endings. The main questions is - Why do we still on the robbers side? Well answer for that would take some pages because its hecking crazy. And 5th season is coming so lets hope for thw best. You can also watch this series with only 1st two seasons its still worth it.	1
10	Awesome	It was the best series that I have ever seen I really liked it Ao cool Amazing	1
10	Op🔥🔥	The best web series on internet today.Professor is the best.	1
10	10/10 for Professor & Tokyo acting	I loved all the seasons and impatiently waiting for season 5	1
3	Long overdue	Season 3 was bad but 4 is a total drag. Way too many inconsistencies. Season 4 has 8 episodes. That's at least 7 too many.	0
10	Season 1 and 2 is Masterpiece	Watch Season 1 and 2 ASAP. Bella Ciao Bella Ciao Bella Ciao Bella Ciao Emotions to Action Everything Perfect Berlin Character is Best And Proffessor Is Love Strong Acting Best Cast Ever For a Series	1
9	Amazingly Thriller TV show must watch	Amazingly stunning, full of fun, thrill n Twists.. I love the show very much.. feel connected with many Characters Professor n his Team Rocks! Eagerly waiting for 5th season of this incredible TV series.	1
9	Addictive and spectacular.	Money heist or la casa de papel is one of the best series on Netflix. The story is brilliant and the characters are real, interesting people. Every season is impeccable flowing nicely together. Don't let the language barrier stop you, sit down, strap in and prepare to be hooked.	1
10	This is a real treat 10/10	Absolutely loving this. It's exciting and intriguing with more twists and turns than you could shake a stick at. Production values are first class but most crucial for me in any good fiction, it's character led and there's a wee smattering of well timed comedy in there to lighten the load. Can't recommend it highly enough.	1
10	Good storyline	"I really enjoyed this drama because it keeps its story line throughout the entire series and keeps the character development too. This drama focuses on every person and and I really enjoy how the story develops, with a reasonable amount of tension and suspense to keep you hooked.

The characters are played really well by the actors and actresses because i really ended up hating Arturito haha.

Its a tense show so be ready XD"	1
10	4th Season is just amazing!	Great series and 4th season is above all the best!	1
10	Incredibly intriguing	This show is a non-stop roller coaster. I see a lot of negative reviews, however 'Money Heist' delivers time after time. The pacing is impeccable, each part of the story leading into another in a way that keeps you wanting more. The plot is thoroughly concise and is very satisfying to see unfold. As an English viewer; I find it utterly refreshing to see some great dramas from the continent. I found 'Money Heist' consistently addictive and always wanted more	1
10	Best TV series ever	Amazing acting. The TV series was made so well thought out. All of the actors were fantastic. Keeps you totally intrigued. Something else ! Loved it !	1

2	It was like rubbing show ever i saw .	The police is not doi Anything just sits there in a camp and the shooting was like there's a game going on not a best scene where you felt good .	0
10	Do in need to explain?	You won't regret seeing it. Your learn a lot from it.	1
3	Don't watch season 3 and 4	Netflix ruined it, it became stupid and stupid, season 1 and 2 were masterpiece, season 3 was fair, season 4 is garbage, it contains a lot of filler, I don't know why Berlin is still there, they could make this season with only one episode	0
10	Perfect, period!	The season 4 really changes the entire dynamics of the plot! There are so many surprises and the way things turn out till the end is delightful to watch. Waiting eagerly for Season 5!!! Bella Ciao!	1

So I prefer to watch it because you are gonna love it.	1
10	One of the best!	I really like this series!!! Every thing is perfect and breathtaking! Im looking forward for the next season.	1
9	Great show with minor flaws	"Loved the show. Extremely entertaining and keeping you glued to the screen. Great plot twists, the whole robbery plan is just gonna mess up your mind!

There are times when you end up shaking your head as they have went too far with the story and it's borderline stupid. They could have easily skip couple of scenes in the first two seasons as well and get to the end quicker. But that's only minor flaws in a really amazing show.

PS. Once you hear Bella Ciao you won't be able to get it out of your head!"	1
10	One of the best show in my life.	After watching all three seasons continue in just 3 days I can't stop my self to write this review. This is the wonderful show, better I will say mastermind show, must watch it. Eagerly waiting for season 4. Love this series.	1
10	Bloody brilliant!	Excellent cat and mouse between the thieves and the police.	1
10	How can I explain in a couple of words	"This was an absolute treat to watch, I loved every second of it, The creativity and execution is second to none...I mean to actually come up with a script like this, absolutely amazes me.

I'm very excited for the 4th season and would like Money Heist to continue in the same vein and that too without having to compromise the adrenaline rush we receive watching the show."	1
10	Couldn't do better	Great plan great heist brilliant actors . Looking for the 4th part professor my guardian angel best character! Bella ciao	1
10	Masterpiece of cinéma!!	A masterpiece you just can't get enough the acting directing , cinematography everything is outstanding i highly recommended .	1
10	Cohones this is good	I actually thought about not seeing this at all. Thought it would be a mediocre show. But this is honestly the best I've seen since breaking bad. The characters are just so good! You gotta love the music and the well timed epic moments. Game of thrones, sorry you are now descending on my top 10 best series ever. This show never really get boring. Sure it has its slowdowns but they are short and once the pace is at its normal high rate it's probably one of the best shows ever.	1
10	Yes It Is	I needed a great show like this. Great characters and sucsessfull script. And i have to say that: Tokio is number one for me!	1
10	Speachless	This is how all the tv shows , no matter the plot , should look like !	1

10	I just love it 😊	I'm speechless I mean this app has everything 😍💕	1
10	Haters gonna hate	"This series is masterpiece...probably most of the haters comes from the US....there,they like to watch bs family comedy series...that's why a lot of good tv series like ""The Expasne"" is cancelled...La casa has his minor...tiny flaws...so what?Great actors,tension,agony and sexy Spanish language....the bad guys are the good guys and vice versa...and you know something?This is the thing in real life too...i'm tired of movies,showing the police as the good guys...they are not in many cases in real life...so respect to the writers of this show....finally,a little bit of truth....10/10...must see"	1
2	Pasan cosas absurdas en la serie	Hay cosas que pasan en la serie que me parecen absurdas!!!!	0
10	It's captivating	There is no way you would start this serie and not want to finish it ! Addictive	1
9	gripping	Intense watch and lovely characters... good plots.......	1
10	Worths every second of it	Well, crime shows are hard to satisfy the crowed, yet La casa de papel was able to impress me and I couldn't get enogh of it. The cast was amazing, they were meant to play their characters! I know if the show was good when I couldn't predict the events. And thankfully it was full of surprises!	1
10	Absolutely one of the best	I watched this series in one go, without sleeping, it is definitely one of the best I ever watched.	1
8	The best heist tv show around!!!	This spanish series in one great heist TV show that i totally recommend. It shares some resemblaces with Prison Break but it´s more about the personal relationships of the robbers, it's a more emotional story, but it never get's boring. For someone who want's to diversify from the usual american culture and TV, this is a very refreshing and original series.	1
8	One word: Masterpiece	Don't get fooled by the low rating some users give. They probably never watched any series or movies that were not produced in Hollywood. Ths series is really good and makes you get involved with the characters. The characters are normal criminals who are led by a genius guy.	1
10	Best program on Netflix	So many twist and turns, will keep you glued to the tv	1
10	Changed the way I see People- The Redemption	"This series is not just a one which has twist and turns, it is with a precise editing and storyline. It made people happy for the heist, and professor is one of a kind and mentor to me. Berlin is so similar to Tbag in prison break. ""Bella Ciao"" Spain"	1
10	i ts amazing	It is amazing how the writer wroted a story so complex and different like this.	1
10	Do Not Watch Dubbed version	It was like being on a holiday away from HOLLYWOOD very well done and needed. But strong warning DO NOT watch the dubbed version on NetFlix. After binge-watching all 13 episodes of the 1st season, I thought it would be a good idea to watch the dubbed version but the English ruins the brilliant work of the Spanish actors.	1
1	It should be an indian series	Bad acting it made me vomit also the fights are mire like an old Indian movie last but not least its gay	0
10	What a show!!!	I think this is the best possible action packed,thrilling show ever on Netflix....these guys really know how to pull it off🔥🔥i blown up,yo..... Can't explain the feeling.... professor and the gang💥💥10 out ah 10...	1
10	I'll try to explain how perfect this is with words	If you haven't seen it already.. JUST DO IT. I don't think I've ever watched a film or series so intense, with so much suspense. I think it's the cleverest thing ever and each episode will leave you shocked. WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE AND YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. And may I mention that in each season something crazy is going on and you do not lose the slightest interest. It's just perfect PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT	1
10	Welcome Manila!	Great to have you p4e5. Finally another worthy and much anticipated support to the Professor.	1
2	mexican tv show	It's so overrated, i don't really like it, no difference from a mexican tv show.	0
2	Waste of time.	How this show get any positive reviews is beyond me.	0
10	exelent	I found this Spanish TV series by chance, I really recommend you watch it. It's one of the best series that I have seen lately. A chess game between the police and the robbers, you will be surprised by its development. You can not foresee anything. (I hope that my review is correct, I'm not a native speaker	1
2	This is so bad. Don't watch it.	Storytelling very poorly crafted. Bad acting. It's ridiculous. If you don't want to waste your time, don't watch it.	0
10	Amazing!	Best series I ever watched, it's a MUST, you watch the whole series no stop!	1
10	BEST THRILLER TV SHOW EVER WATCHED IN HISTORY	I watched season 1 to season 4. I felt like i am not in the world ,literally i got addict to this show(MONEY HEIST). On 3rd sept 2021 (season 5 vol 1) also came out. It was mind blowing performance,i would like to say in eposide 5 of vol 1( tokyo death was heart touching i cried like i didn't cried ever in my life. I kept ac on while watching but i was sweating a lot,This suspense,thriller,performance is mind blowing. MOST RECOMMENDED SHOW, YOU WILL GET ADDICT TO THIS SHOW FOR SURE.	1
10	Must Watch !!	One of the best series I have seen. It is un-imaginable that a single heist-based series can be of this level and a plot this impregnable. The narrative is fantastic with often going back and coming forth in timeline. All the characters are delved deep into creating an overall impact to the whole story. The plot has enough twists to keep you hooked from the first minute of the show. All the actors have played their roles with equal elan. Must Watch !!	1
10	The best right now!	The best series I've seen in the last 3 years. It is the best combination of drama, action and humor that I have seen in a series.	1
10	Twist and turns	From the first glance it looks like a typical European TV show and to be honest I don't usually watch this genre however, the twists and story progression is really good. I gave it a 10/10 because it was good enough to attract someone who doesn't watch this specific genre of TV shows. The voice acting is not 10/10 but the show itself compensated for the lack of a good dubbed voice acting.	1

10	Money heist...🤤🤑💰..	It's a very good n epic web series ever people say breaking bed is best but let them know they're is something called money heist 😏.. After watching it I felt to good n some quotes literally changed my thoughts. N how we should take decisions even when we have so much to lose.. well if I start I ont end.. hope u could write this much in my answer paper 😅😂... lil but sad abt hearing tht seasons is last😔😌..	1
1	Silly and insulting to the intellect of the viewer	Failed attempt to imitate prison brake style. Very cheesy and shallow style. No logic. Unnecessary scenes (80%). can be a movie or 1 season. This is not Cinema it's a stupid commercial tv show	0
1	Worse than you think....	One of the worst series, I have ever watched... How police can be so stupid, full of idiots, and dumb.... Means while watching this series, throw your common sense outside the window... Seriously... At least use some common sense, when you're making this kind of series... I wish i couldn't give any 🌟 to this bu**sh**... I wasted my time on this series.... Don't watch it... Strongly recommended...	0
10	This is the best thrilling show I have seen, and I have seen many	It's just the perfect mix of crime, thrilling, love and friendship. You really bond with the characters, and what I really love is that you can actually relate to the bad guys and understand them. I was glued to my TV and watched it all very fast! One of the best shows I have seen, and I have seen a lot.	1
10	Best thing on internet😍😍	To be honest i have never wanted anything like this, ones i started watching this show i could not stop myself until it ends, this is the best show i have ever watched.	1
10	It's wonderful	People say they don't get the hype, whyd you watch 4 seasons if you don't like it. This is a masterpiece.	1
10	Seamless	It's a part of probability that a great many improbable things will happen. And this series proves that point. Since we must suspend our disbelief while engrossed in the story, Money Heist makes it easy with plausible plot twists that keep the viewer on the edge of the couch. Great production values, superior acting.	1
10	Don't know why people hate it	It's actually one of the best action series, it's amazing like you feel that you're with them and it's great, really enjoyed it	1
10	BEST SHOWW EVER	I luv this show. I waas so sad when I thoght it ended at seasaon 2, then when I saw seaason 3 on netflix i was sups excitd!! It is a must watch! so good	1
10	Liked it	Don't compare real life to money heist, coz it's excellent work of fiction and imagination just enjoy the series. And Support them.	1

Evoking heart felt joy & tears as I fell in love with the characters and ever twisting plot. Testament to everyone involved for all the love sweat and tears you have put into creating this masterpiece!!!!

GRACIAS <3"	1
9	For me THE BEST in terms of suspense and action	It just keeps you waiting for whatever's happening next Addicting	1
10	By far the best series made so far	This series is a benchmark to the industry and raises every bar, right from acting to scripting. Every actor in the series delivered excellent performances. The cinematography is amazing. Every episode is highly gripping and makes you stick through the end. This is truly a 11 out of 10 rating worth series. The team is amazing and I hope they continue making new seasons of this series.	1
8	10/10 for the First 3 Seasons, But Season 4 Disappoints	"I've binge watched the season 4 today for 7 straight hours and all I've got at the end is disappointment. Professors unimpressive plans, poorly written characters & unrealistic scenes are the major drawbacks of S4. Hope they bounce back.

S4 Rating 7/10"	1
10	Season 4 a masterpiece	Doesn't disappoint at all. Absolute entertainment and tension. Every second is enjoyable. Watch it again and again u won't get bored. Keep this up. Love the whole crew especially professor ♥	1
10	Professional Professor	The Series that make you thrilled, if you watch the first episode then you stop at the end.	1
10	Just outstanding	Fantastic.Too much suspens. Brilliant acting from every actor in this series.One of the best tv series so far.😍	1
10	NALIBITING	A great series made with great taste. The actors seemed to settle in perfectly. Everything was to be loved about it.	1
10	The best movie	The best movie i had ever seen in my life...Very nice story with action with love😍😍😍this movie its 10/10	1
3	This series is the definition of bad script writing	Everybody told me to watch this series. EVERYBODY So i did... And i was completely disappointed about the really poor writing. I can sit down and make a list about how many things that had a tremendous effect in the plot, were presented to us as a coincidence or were luckily discovered by the police or the thieves. SO MANY DAMN COINCIDENCES ARE THE BEST SIGN TO A BAD WRITING In my opinion this series is the definition of a scriptwriter which seriously lacks talent or he was damn bored about writing a nice script.	0
8	A long series but worth it.	"Watching the English-dubbed version it's a little hard to get into it but things pick up after 7-8 episodes. The ""second"" season has much more action and rapid pacing, leading to a satisfying finale. Underlying theme is a little socialist, printing and stealing money out of thin air, compared towhat the Euro Reserve Bank does on a major scale."	1
10	You must see this	Just finished season 2 in 2 days. Very nice serie with a lot of different varieties of scenes. The Spanish language didn't bother it me, actually I like it.	1

10	"""Bella Ciao"""	"The best work I ever watched lately. That harmony was great between characters and music in this serie. What can I say more:)

I hope we can see more great works, like this one."	1
10	BEST SERIES EVER!	This is for sure the best series ever. It is incredible how ridiculous are some people that doesn't accept the fact that are other series better than their preferred one. This is for sure the best series I've already watched, I couldnt stop watching it and I watched everything in 3 days. The actors are great! They are natural without any special effect. And fuck your shitty technical problems that you have may noticed! I'm not a film-maker.	1
10	extremely good	I liked the show very much. you'll have a pretty good time.	1

1	Support Ethnic Cleansing	Support Ethnic Cleansing. Shame on you Free PALESTINE.	0
8	What happens when a character study show runs out of character study?	"The first 2-3 seasons are exquisite, unique TV. At the end of season 3 however, they start to run out of character depth to explore, which was partially what made the earlier seasons so great.

In S4, they try to make up for this with too many flashbacks, especially to Berlin's life. In S5 they make up for it with too many action sequences that most of their audience find dull and unoriginal."	1
1	Despite of their perfomance, you should Read!	"Dear la casa de papel team It's Palestine not Isr-ael ! Don't be foolish and read the history and facts before you speak.

Oooh yes but maybe becouse you used to steal money so you stand with who steal the land, well i will tell you.. WE ARE Exist We ARE PALESTINIAN AND OUR LAND IS CALLED PLAESTINE FROM THE RIVER TO THE SEA.. It's PALESTINE 🇵🇸🍉🇵🇸"	0

9	Heart pumping and enjoyable!	"Latest season 5 / Part 1 is not the season audience expected, may be due to highest expectations already, but it is still thrilling as earlier seasons and enjoyable throughout.

This is rarity of this show that almost every character leaves a mark on the audience! Recommended for binge watching to get the best of the show!"	1
1	Dubbed DO I NEED TO SAY MORE?!	It DUBBED why is NETFLIX producing so MANY DUBBED shows. It's disconnecting either make a show in its original language or English I do NOT want to see out of sync lips and voice over acting from someone else ITS HORRIBLY DISCONNECTING AND unbelievable . PERIOD! IF I COULD RATE IT A ZERO I WOULD.	0
1	Awful	Horrible 😑 i don't like it and worst work team ever.	0
2	Literally the dumbest show	"All actions are the most dumb and unrealistic as it can be.

First of all thesis we don't rob people is nonsense.

They literally rob people by devalueing their money.

Every scene in this show is pure nonsense.

Even the dumbest police on earth not that dumb.

Even if police are bad, this don't make criminals good."	0
9	Season 3	Very emotional, my tears rolled multiple times. Just can't wait to watch the next volume. Veri excited.	1
9	La casa de papel! 🗣	Every season of this show is worth watching but that water and gold hiest looked a little bit fake otherwise waiting for the season five 👐!	1
1	Why	"Why did they even bother to dub this?!?! It would be better in the original language with subtitles......

The dubbing isn't the worse thing (don't get me started) but it really makes something go from poor to terrible."	0
4	A populist who sings bella ciao !	At fist you think it will surprise you with a complex idea but wait, it is a serie that just tries to make everyone happy after watching. I could say acting. Locations and soundtrack is fine, story line is not realistic. They dont diminish main characters at correct time. Criminals power and freedom has been considered over estimated.	0
10	Legend robbey!	My favorite webseries and i will strongly recommend you to watch it. Its worth.	1
8	A non - stop entertaining Show till 2nd of season further story will be.....	"There is no scope that the show is a non-stop entertainment show but from season 2 onwards things start to reverse.

Although we will not call it useless, the start of season 3 is very good, but as the show progresses, the series sometimes seems boring.

Season 4 seems a bit boring in the middle, but it would be absolutely natural to say that the show takes the stage with a very good story. And it is not at all surprising to say that this show will always be a secret on the hearts of fans."	1
8	Season 5 should be the last	Money is a great show, one of the best heist show/movie of all time but it's becoming unrealistic, they should end it in season 5.	1
8	The best Stress movie	Allwrite a good movie but Season 3 and 4 just remake of season 1 and 2 and this is a little bad but it best to see for action.	1
9	Good	If you manage to arrive at the end of Season 1 you will understand the hype with this TV show. From that moment, you become addicted to it. I am waiting for the final season.	1
9	Recommend series	This show is a must watch. From the characters to the directing and visual effects.. it s well done. I really like this show and it has a great mastermind and logic and strategies. All i can say is perfect.	1
3	Belo average acting, plot and direction (highly overrated)	The series is highly overrated. the plot has counless loopholes, bad and overacting by most of the actors. I suggest you to not waste the time for this. YouTube creator can make better content than this.	0
10	Must Watch, Outstanding Performance and finest story	This web series is worth watching. It's a war between theif and police hahahaxd. If you are searching for any web series which has suspense and a powerful story than just watch this. Once you started you will finish it as soon as possible. This will change your whole mindset about thief's and it will just make you surprise and addictive by the story. Just stop reading here if you haven't watched it than just go and watch.	1
10	Don't judge, simply go watch it !!	"While you know that everything you watch either web series or movie, they are mostly 90% complete work of fiction so anything can happen in the story.

We are here to enjoy the drama and not judge knowing it's fictional drama while there are stupid people out there judging everything they see.

Just enjoy man, it's for enjoyment! From my point of view, it's a worth watch with full of action, thrill, suspense and good cast, go watch it!!"	1
8	Amazing but	This show is just incredible. But I think this should end on season 2. You know, the first two seasons are just unbelievable. But the next two are average, but still, they are not that bad. You can watch the show. Loved that.	1
10	Big fan	Good serier tv show made from spinsh nice work and profisnal like it so much all of you whatch it is exlient Thankyou for all cast and crow Thankyou for hard work	1

9	The best Spanish series.	It's a lot of fun, but it requires more creativity.	1
2	Disappointing!	Please give inspector Racquel a bow to tie her hair! The hype the drama .. nothing is worth it! Can stop watching after season 2. Atleast the ending of heist 1 is goes down with a good fight.. But good action seasons, too much drama for a heist, have shown the police in utmost mess... Not living up the craze!	0
3	overrated	It should have ended in season 2. seasons 3 and 4 are boring, full of unnecessary drama and repetition of seasons 1 and 2.	0
3	Gets dumb after season 2	Character lost common sense and gets dumb after season 2. What's up with Indians obsessing over this show?? I never heard of this show in USA/Canada and got to know when an Indian friends at work told me about this show. Just a bad show and bad writing and characters are very irrational with the judgments most of the time.	0
10	Honestly we love it at home	Do yourself a favor and watch it in the original language on Netflix it makes a world of difference the Arturo character and female police officer gets on your nerves eventually but overall we love it	1
10	Honestly we love it	The Arturo character is annoying but everything else is on point.	1
9	Loved the series but disappointed they added political issues	Loved the story, loved the acting. Really enjoyed watching this series. But I am disappointed they add all these personal political issues they added in. Not impressed about that	1
2	Changing values	I was really astonished to see the overwhelming response to this serial by the young generation. If this kind of logic, supporting the crime and illicit relations is acceptable to our coming generation then the world has really changed and senior citizens like me, who believe in morals, ethics and good nature are fools in today's world. The first two seasons have some merit but the next seasons are utterly foolish and showing the entire Spanish police force and their intelligence as a dumbest lot.	0
10	Part 4 - review	Great series and a great season but I am really disappointed in the way Nairobi was taken out. If at all you had to end the character, she could have died fighting Ghandia. Not to be killed by him in armed. She's a fighter!	1
1	Overrated	Plain soap opera and overrated. Was not able to complete first episode. People are having long conversation about there love life in between Heist. Show will progress very little over the episode.	0
10	First series ever	One of finest Series,all seasons has emotions, feeling, romantic, twists n turn. We strongly agree the lengthy episodes.	1
1	Waste of resources for everyone involved!	My hopes were low but seeing the first 2 seasons I decided that low is a pretty high bar! To bad that a lot of kids are watching this garbage making role models. People, there are a lot of good shows out there.	0
2	So annoying	Like said before, after a promising start, it just get so annoying like a torture. I don't know how these caracters are loveable, but I just keep watching it with a hope, that they will fail. If the police is as stupid as in the show, than the world is screwed...	0
9	La Casa de Papel	It's refreshing! The beauty and good figure of the hostess is neuroticism, which is the time bomb of the team. Like Moscow, although a criminal, but is a good father.	1
2	Hyped for no reason.	Changed rating from 8 to 2 after watching season 4. First 2 seasons were great. But as soon as this was hyped up here in India I got more excited about it but it ended up as a total dud. Used to be much better.	0
9	Fantastic!	An amazing experience to watch this one where you root for characters!	1
10	Amazing	"Wow what a series! I never wanted it to end. Even watched the phenomenon which was also amazing.

Would highly recommend to anyone.

Wish there was another hundred seasons. By far the best thing I've ever watched."	1
8	First two season was good,but then was terrible	In last season creators of TV series showed us ,that they don't have creativity.Because they repeat same narrative ,again and again.In the begin it was good crime TV show with some plot holes ,but some way it was interesting.Characters weren't deep ,but they were memorable.	1
2	Long and Drawn Out	The first 4 seasons could have been completed in 1 season with 8-10 episodes. 70-80% all of the scenes are long and drawn out with horrendous overreacting. Most of these performances would not make it in a burlesque show.	0
10	Just amazing.	A very good series. Will keep you on edge. The writing of the show is so incredible.	1
10	Incredible	If you're looking for one of the most thought out series out there, this one is for you. There is absolutely never a dull moment!	1
3	Don't think and you'll love it	The first two episodes are gripping with an interesting plot and even more interesting set of characters. Then, the characters make stupid decisions to create tension that just gets exhausting. Every episode there's a scene where the characters point guns at each other for no reason. At a certain point I had to ask myself, is this a show about a bank robbery or is it a confused romance show instead? It honestly became hard to tell. But, if you want brainless, in your face television, this is a perfect series to indulge.	0
4	Netfilx destroys everything that touches	First two seasons were melodramatic, but veery interesting to watch, but from third it is unbearable.	0
10	Best web series ever	This web series stands high because of the connect we make with its stars.	1
10	Best of the all	I can say only one thing that this is the most underrated series of netflix , (suspens , drama , romance , thrill , action , human emotions , such a gripping screenplay , different plot , and last but not the least this series has professor , what can u dream more	1
10	It's okay	From the begining yes you will get mad with those character but at the same time what i love is their relationships in the gang. And it becomes bad as Nairobi are not deserved to be executed like that. She should be alive until the end! Don't understand why such writers. I just hoping that seeing Gandia dead but..hmmm. Still follow and obsess with this series until i get the final real ending. Just stop killing good characters because it's sucks.	1
8	Need an ending	You can learn being smart and caring, it contains the whole idea about that. But i don't understand the idea of season 3 & 4 or we should expect another season with a proper ending.	1
4	Oke, but too much boring talks	It's oke. Entertaining enough. But all the melodramatic talking between important plot 'twists' are just unbelievable and boring as hell.	0
10	Best crime thriller web series in the world	Best web series that contain thirller action story suspense in crime drama series that best	1
8	Series 4 is practically The Matrix	They should have signed Keanu Reeves to play Gandía, after all the way he dodges bullets is definitely like The Matrix. Series 4 is still very much entertaining, although there's too much going back to memory lane and not enough real time action.	1
10	Excellent series	People are living professors role. It's a crazy series complete entertainment. Must watch.	1
9	Super	Amazing show, I started watching to check what is crazy about it and now I am addicted	1
10	Brilliant!	Brilliant is a perfect word to describe everything about this show. Watched the entire 4 seasons during the COVID lockdown and enjoyed it thoroughly. Hoping for season 5 soon.	1
9	A beautiful series with so much character depth	"From the plot, to the characters and to the cinematography, this series is mind blowing. It has some of the best characters I have seen. I love the way its executed. There are some very good scenes and some that don't captivate you as much.

I would give it 10 if some scenes were more logical and believable."	1
2	Berlin	First of all, first chapter was awesome. Proffesor had thrown curves. Second chapter was good. Also third chapter wasnt boring. It was different and original atmosphere. But I cant say anything about fourth chapter. I watched just flashbacks. They know we missed Berlin and they used this trump. They showed us Berlin,Berlin,Berlin... I couldnt finish last chapter. I was really bored because of flashbacks. My rate was 8/10 before the newest session, but now it regress 2/10	0
8	Great but tons of unnecessary scenes	U have no idea The amount of scenes' i had to skip, believe me, I'm a tv addictor and i know when things are hellaa boring, plus if u Gonna watch every scene in this show, its good but do know you're wasting your time , Imagine Watching 2 parrots talking to each other and fighting and they ends up bestfriends it's exactly like this with most of characters ...just talking talking and talking but its a rlly good show that I haven't seen in a while!	1
8	An excellent tv series halted by season 4	It was reasonably good series at the start especially in the first three parts. Apart from extra dragging the story line and drab emotions of every character, it performed reasonably well. But the season 4 put a serious halt into its success. Just dragged the story without any rich content and ended the season without any result. Season 4 would put a serious damage to its popularity.	1
8	Unsettling	It's third season and still the series blend in. However, I found a great deal of emotional and unnecessarily long scenes regarding lovers. Please don't turn up a crap.	1
10	Just amazing	For sure make you happy and enjoy yourself for watching this series Professor character is the name of love💙and Berlin also.	1
9	Season 4 Recap	Egypt has been mentioned in First episode of Season 4 when Tamio told the it manager to disrupt the internet in their place like what happened in Egypt in 2011. And Since am from Egypt, I like the idea how they pointed to how governments go beyond to crackdown on freedom of opinions. What a good scene	1
10	BEST OF THE BEST!	This is byfar the best show ever on netflix. If u havent watched this series yet, believe me it is worth all the hype. U will get hooked to this as soon as u watch the first episode. Only few series can make this in their first episode itself (like prison break, breaking bad, stranger things).	1
10	Awesome	This is one of the best series out there on Netflix	1
10	10/10	The show is slow paced and yet somehow fast paced at the same time. There's a lot of action throughout that keeps you on your toes. It just keeps getting better and better.	1
10	EPISODES ARE MISSING!!!	The episode list is wrong. First season has 13 epidoses and second has 9. Could somebody fix that? Btw it is my favourite show of all time, simply brilliant script, with extraordinary acting.	1
10	Really Really good	I fell in love with Money Heist since episode 1. I love the cast and the way everyone played their roles. Just finished it and i would watch it again, best tv-series.	1
10	Masterpiece!	I came late to this show but wow! I have read some criticism of the show but really would it not be boring to be executed perfectly? There are flaws, sure, but overall pretty damn good. A very clever script; excellent actors; some nail-biting stuff and great camaraderie amongst the thieves. Television is supposed to either educate or amuse. This certainly kept me entertained!	1
10	A show worth watching after a long time.	I avoided this show for months looking at the reviews which say it's overrated. I won't believe from now on. You watch it yourself and decide. I specifically made account for this review. If you're a fan of Prison Break, Dexter etc this show will hit the right spot. It will scratch the itch you have for wanting to watch Brainy psychological warfare.	1
10	Must watch	Please see this on your vacation. Cause if u start watching this, u won't be able to skip watching before you finish. Stories are so inter locked & not a single moment here is boring.	1
8	Nathan moyne	I find the serie not very realistic.Because it is not possible for criminals to enter so easily such a secured building whith so many secrets inside and so well guarded. For me it is so impressive that the teacher anticipates all the mouvement of the police , it is so impressive that it seems unrealistic	1
10	Loving Season 2!	Season 2 is a masterpiece, and whilst a little outlandish at times, uses scientific principles incredibly well....a very well written show. The introduction of Sierra is a beatiful way of getting rid of the Deus ex el professor that made this show frustrating to watch beforehand.	1
10	One of its kind	Its unlike any other web series you have ever seen. It will keep you on the edge of your seat whereas at the same time expose you to whole another level of entertainment. Every character of show is beautifully written and execution is perfect. It will keep you craving for more.	1
9	Marvellous	It's a epnderful series, waiting desperately for forth fourth season	1
10	Outstanding!	Maybe the best series I have ever watched. It has everything Love friendship fights laughter fear... It's totally unpredictable it keeps you in a constant agony from the beginning until the end The casting is amazing and the directing is one in 1 million you just can't pause it !	1
8	Mindblowing	Fast paced, Thrill, Action 10/10...Perfect crime series package.	1
8	Smart and worth your time	This show is so smart and interesting, I'm not left bored even for a minute just clear up your schedule when you start watching it because you're gonna want to binge-watch a whole season in one sitting.	1
8	Highly unpredictable	If you wanna test a series or a movie and know how good is the storyline, predictability is the assessment. The flow of the events and the intelligent twist throughout the course of the series can simply tell that is one of the greatest series in recent time. Although, the series has kinda political view which socialism and whether you accept or agree with what they try to address or dictate the direction and the great job by the writer and the cast make you hooked up to it.	1
8	Season 3 is a EXCESS BAGGAGE	I felt I am watching some 80s show.... I would have stopped at season two and would say down the line in the history of heist genre tv series. La Casa De Papel was one of the greatest show on earth. It has let me down..	1
10	Awesomeness at 100%	Once again, the team showed us the full potential of artistic approach in contemporary creative process. If I leave professional critics, I should not observe other critics, but as 'user review' I could just make a point on 5 star and less reviews. The note and review in this case is the reflect of their own life. A lot of hate, and nothing more. I don't think that they even watched the serie!	1
9	Entertainment Guaranteed	It is not among my best shows ever,but I'm gonna give it a firm 9. Highly entertaining but lack of any meaningful message taht actually matters.	1
9	Dillution?	"The opening two seasons were phenomenal ones ,top quality edge of the stuff.I couldn't sing high enough praises ,and recommended it to anybody who would listen.

Unless you having something in line to top that or come close to it,then i think you should wait until you do.It is great to see the gang back together of course,and it wasn't terrible.I will wait see to how this chapter comes to a close with season 4 before casting a true reflection ..

Definitely watch it if reviews are putting you off,form your own opinion,it was not the worst binging experience ever."	1
9	Difficult task for the writers	After the ending of Part 2 of the series, I was uncertain about how the story would turn in the coming parts. As expected the writers were faced with many loose ends and holes that needed to be filled in the new season. Although noticable, it was done well. The plot is similar yet different than what weve seen before giving it a refreshing feel to the series. Well done overall.	1
8	Jazan	Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice	1
10	Greetings from Istanbul	DARPHANE EVIMIZ,BERLIN BABAMIZ. AksIyon,zeka,dram ne ararsanIz var	1
8	From masterpiece to average	A must watching TV series. First 2 seasons were very good.Fitst Netflix did huge mistake on season 3 and 4.	1
10	A true Masterpiece	An awesome TV show to binge which will leave you on edge on every episode.	1
9	I love it!	It keeps me! I love Berlin! The best Spanish TV serie!	1
10	The perfect robbery	One of the best series I heve ever seen!I am waiting dor the next season...	1
10	Great show	"Great plot! Cool scenario with a lot of twists. You end up wishing the ""villains"" will escape. Nice cast also and loved to see all episodea in spanish"	1
10	Perfect...	Most see it... I really enjoy watching it i be so excited to watch the next episode...	1
9	Well Thought Out	"The plot is very well written, although the performance of the characters may not be the most appropriate in some moments. In any case, there is a constant climate of uncertainty, which always unfolds in totally unexpected resolutions. Without many ""clichés"", this Spanish production manages to compete in equality with those produced by the cinematographic industry. Worth following!"	1
9	One of the best heist series ever	Well organized, thrilling, entertaining... a full package that makes you eager to watch the next episode. Even though the series is in Spanish bit you can be sure you will understand everything and you will not be disappointed.	1
10	Stunning, fabulous, brilliant and all else	Unbelievable script, direction, acting and above all a script and editing, all leading to perfection. You may have seen or read a lot of spoilers but inspite of reading it please see this show. It's nonconformist, it's made to perfection and it's gripping in a nice happy way. I can write so much about it but will leave it at a ....go watch it. Safe to watch on a flight and no nudity etc. one of the best there is in Netflix.	1
10	Extremely good...	I can definitely recommend it who loves an existing story and great actors.	1
10	Must see	Loved everything about it except the death of Berlin if he would have lived this would the greatest show ever. That being said the show was spectacular, ending was beautiful. 9.99/10 only because of Berlin. Now I know who the bad guys really are. Still deserves 10/10	1
10	Got To Watch	I enjoyed every single second of this mind-blowing serie!	1
10	Genuine Masterpiece	This might be my first review and the shortest of all, but short doesn't really mean that I have got no good words for this show; this show's a genuine masterpiece. The acting, the casting, the plot, the progression and the title of course makes this show literally ONE OF THE BEST. It's going to make history and the coming generation is going to watch it like The Shawshank Redemption. For anyone still having doubts about watching the show, I must say give it a try. You'll definitely LOVE this.	1
10	Really good!!	Surprised to see bad reviews! Funny looks like people either love it or hate it completely. Probably the haters are watching it in English instead of Spanish! You need to watch it in the original language and use subtitles if you do understand the language. My Spanish is not good enough to understand but with subtitles it s perfect!	1
10	Must Seen	I was Searching so long for a Serie like that. Unbeliveable masterpiece. From beginning till the end so good.	1
4	Seriously???	"I cannot understand all the top reviews of this show. I won't call it complete garbage, but I'm not far from it.

Cheesy characters with sound editing that is so ridiculous you tend to LOL when you hear some of the voices connected to the actors they are supposed to portray.

Anyway, if you're bored and have watched everything else on Netflix, then this will fill some time, but if there's just about anything else to watch on TV, I would suggest you pick that instead."	0
10	Nice popcorn entertainment	The script is like a Swiss cheese though, therefore dont pay too much attention, sit back, relax, and enjoy great actors	1
10	Best Heist Series Ever	Best heist series I have ever seen. Excellent character development. Brilliant plot and attention to detail. BRAVO! Can we pray for Part 3...?!	1
10	Watch this show, like right now!	Oh my God! I can't put into words how great this show is! The acting is fantastic and I actually cared for the main actors/actresses. The heist was fascinating to see thought out and actually carried out. The ending also gets you right in the feels. I can't waiy until season 3 in 2019!	1
10	One of the best box sets out there	Fantastic series loved every minute! A must watch!	1
10	Wow	One of the best series i ve ever seen Great acting Great story Great plan .	1
10	A Truly breathtaking masterpiece	"The narrative, the plot, the depiction of vulnerabilty of heist men, the confidence of the plan being full proof and yet the unfolding of events which were never thought of, was amazing. Every character esp. Berlin and El Professor are pleasure to watch and as the series builds, you feel As if you are one of them. ""muchas gracias por un regalo increíble"""	1
8	"""Light meal"" after a strenuous working day"	"It is easily digestible, and that is perhaps the recipe for success of this series. Of course there are smarter series with more depth - but who says it has to be like this? The bad reviews are justified, but the series doesn't want to do it any differently. The series entertained me greatly (even if there are some logical flaws); a light meal after a strenuous working day with pseudo-intellectuals. Just what "" I "" needed. Ciao bella."	1
10	Recomended	Ira an increadible serie but arriba the end i feel that the story is incunclude	1
9	Great Show	I believe this is the first spain TV show I have ever watched and it's great!	1
10	The best tv show	Must watch this show its amazing love the story and the idea its great Also in eglish its good too	1
10	Refreshing and brilliant	Amazing script, actors and sets. Original in all aspects and it's gonna take something sublime to top this series in a similar category.	1
10	Amazing series	"It is an amazing series, the actors, director, write, scripter, all were amazing.

Each episode had its gripping moment. Full of thrillers and action."	1
10	Absolute Unit	I have seen a lot of tv series and this was hands down one of the best. So many twists and turn and suspense i couldnt stop watching. Was late for work 3 days in a row because I couldnt stop pressing next episode. 11/10 about to re-watch. Buenas noches!	1
10	Great foreign tv show!	This show is so good. I was very reluctant to watch it when all my friends told me to. I am a Spaniard and I've never been very fond of Spanish TV or movies but when just half way through the pilot I fell in love with the show. The characters are great, they have great stories and their names fit them perfectly. The story is very refreshing and original too.	1
10	A Gem	One of the best shows on Netflix. They take risks American shows don't. And now Netflix is making a third season!!	1
9	Great show..	I postponed my self to start watching because it wasn't in English ... but when you start, you can't stop! It deserves even more my respect! Great work, good story, good characters.. Just announced today a third part in 2019... hope the good work continues.	1
1	Voice over??? Seriously???	I'm sure it's great but........they're speaking in Spanish and it's voiced over in English. I can't watch this.	0
3	Strictly Prohibited	"Does not make any sense at any point, Total -. s h i t I bear the show till 2nd season s 6 episode, just hoping for it to get better but naaa naaa .

Strictly prohibited ,

Below average show.

Find a better show to watch.

Will never forgive Netflix for this one. So far worst show of mine."	0
10	Masterpice!!!	Money heist is The best 🐐 if you are worried about palestin people what the hell are you doing here ? Shut the f*#ck up and don't watch israel supported series , watch palestine documentries (i'm not israelite and my Country has political problems with israel but i'm not interested in political issues) sorry for my bad grammer , it's not good cause i'm not english.	1
1	Most Disgusting Series	Totally a waste of time, could not watch after 1-4.	0
10	Epic!	This show is a constant roller-coaster in an exciting way! Excitement starts from part 1 and lasts beyond last episode of part 4 making you wanting more. Amazing character building, clever story, awesome music, and powerful moments. I actually treated this series as 2 parts story. Surprise to see some negativity creeping from people in later seasons however i feel those rating doesn't do justice as the show only keeps getting more interesting. Cant wait for part 5	1
10	Incredible	This show is... INCREDIBLE. Up there in my top 3 for sure. Wow.	1
3	Deadly slow unbelievably stupid	Heisters dumber than police, police dumber than heisters. All heisters supposedly are desperate for the money while acting as stupid and emotional as they can. The police operation is also annoyingly unrealistic and stupid. On the top of that it's terribly slow. Don't get me wrong you might love it as all my friends did.	0
10	Fabulous	Season 3 was borderline but wow does season 4 make up for it!!! Reviews that its plot is unbelievable, jeez have you watched GOT??? Great characters,loved it Cant wait for season 5	1
10	Enjoy the show	Don't forget, it's just a show to entertain us. So enjoy the show..	1
10	Best show right after Breaking Bad	This series is shows how much a great screenplay can enhance a normal storyline. Actors are top notch. Just when you think everything is coming to an end, you see new beginnings in the story. What a rollercoaster ride. don't miss.	1
10	The best show ever	I wish this never end I love this show so much please add more parts	1
10	The best series	I live in Iraq, This is the best series I have ever watched, I highly recommend to everyone... Thanks for all the staffs	1
10	They will always be in our Heart.	"This is a perfectly crafted masterpiece of all tv series in the WORLD!! Lot of messages, Lot of emotions, blood pumping moments, heart freezing actions. unexpected twist and turns. and pure brilliance.

the cast is perfect, the direction is phenomenal, the story is out of the world. This is perfection at its best.

the best tv show ever seen in any language. and they will always be in our heart"	1
9	Bella Ciao!	This is one of the show which grasps you from the beginning up to the end. It has all the drama, thrill, story, and the mastermind that makes this series the perfect heist series. It is one of the greatest thing that came out of Netflix Spain. This series has all the characters that make a greatest heist of SPAIN. In short, it is a perfect heist series.	1
10	Out of this world!	It's a must see series! One of the best I ever seen. Two thumbs up!	1
10	Just watch it...	Its one of the best mankind creation in this field i have seen... Its a masterpiece... Actors have done their work more than best... Thanks to all thr team for providing such a great show	1
10	Addictive	Can't stop watching. Impossible to unlike the story.	1
8	Good Enough	If you like movies like the italian job, than this show is for you. The drama doesn't really go off track when it came to presenting a well planed heist. Although there were some predictable parts, the overall result was wonderful. The performances were, as well, top notch. Another plus about this series is that the pace is well managed, so, even though the events take place during the course of a few days, the audiance doesn't fell bored. However, I do feel a bit uneasy about season three, as the heist is over after season two.	1
4	idea is good but messed up characters with many points unconvincing	The idea is good but messed up characters with many points unconvincing. Deliberately prolonging the story.	0
4	Ridiculous plot	The plot of the series is intelligent and promising during the first few episodes, but after a while the story becomes more and more ridiculous: dozens of highly trained special police forces seem to be the dumbest and clumsiest police in the universe, firing thousands of bullets without hardly ever hitting any clear and unprotected targets, while the robbers never miss a single shot and are always 50 steps ahead. So ridiculous it become frustrating.	0
1	Good but way too long	The complexity of the planning is enthralling but there are many naive plot pony's and the whole thing is WAY too long.	0
10	It's a Dali !!!	From Berlin to Moscow, Rio to Tokyo, Denver, Nairobi, Helsinki & Oslo The professor & Raquel Murillo, This was by far the best tv show I washed since breaking bad. I washed it all in 3 days.	1
10	One of the best series in Netflix	A spanish Masterpiece, just will say that.............................................................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
9	Great series	I have only positive things to say about this series. One of the best writing I've seen in a long time. All the characters are different and interesting in their own way. The plot is fresh and unpredictable.	1
10	Speechless!!	This is one of the best series I've ever seen. Truly Mindblowing... I can watch it over and over again. great acting, I literally couldn't sleep after watchting this masterpiece! A must watch!	1

1	Worst drag ever	This was one season drama dragged uselessly to so many. I lost the focus and interest after 2nd season.	0
10	An Amazing Series	S1 was the very best season in the movie. 10/10 S2 was good and the ending was amazing 9/10 I Still Didnt see S3 and S4 For me, It is an amazing heist film.	1
10	Amazing!	I'm glad i finished the series without a heart attack haha, unlike other series that are 50min of boredom with only a good cliffhanger, La Case de Papel is INTENSE all the way through. Its straight to the point with some good parallel stories so we get to know the characters. It has a great message against capitalism, with communist anthem. The first season is better than the second, but the whole experience is amazing.	1
10	An Amazing Series	S1 was the best season of this heist movie 10/10 S2 was drama , thriller halfaway and the last 2 episodes was awesome 9/10 I still didn't see S3 &S4 I Don't know why U guys say Should Have Stop on S2. This series has a many awards and nominees. They Have To Expand the movie. If it stops on S2 it will be very short movie In short word It is an Amazing Action- Packed Thriller Movie	1
4	Huge Disappointment	I've never posted a review before, but I must say I agree with the lowest ranking opinions. It's poor written and predictable, with zero charecter development. I skipped from ep.3 to the last one and everything was as I expected. I still don't understand why the huge hype.	0

10	Great Story Line	I think nobody couldn't remake any series like this In this series all types of scene like sad, romantic, happy, fighting, war, betray, and mind boggling story No one can know what's going to happen next.	1
1	Shame on u	"You support the killer!!!!!!!!!!

Palestine will always be free, you need to change the subject of the series and show your real face as a kill supporter."	0
1	Shame	Some of the creators and actors supporting child killers (Zionist), read more people! Open your minds and your eyes! Choose the right side, use your humanely side!	0
10	The best show	Money heist is the best show I've seen and nothing will ever beat it! It is so exciting! Ignore all the bad reviews, it is a perfect series. Watch it!	1
2	The killed the show	It can't be worse, the last 3 seasons are only speaking about the LGBTQ, and far away from the main concept of the show, so sad, how they killed this piece.	0
1	Superb	Just saw money heist season 5 hindi version just wants to say fantastic, I will not realise how time gone to watch 5 episode.	0
3	Not What I Expected	"I was expecting the typical witty, fun heist story with clever tricks, ruses, and split second timing. Money Heist was the exact opposite. Slow, dull, paper thin characters and extremely unlikely scenarios.

I checked out after Season 1. I just couldn't cope with the dumb scenarios anymore. I swear no character had an IQ above 70. Except for the Professor who might range in the 80's. No seriously, his team consisted of eight people who consisted of true bottom feeders - murderers and other failed criminals on the lam. The hostages are not much better.

Music was good though."	0
4	Got really dull really quickly	"Shallow, predictable characters didn't hold my interest for very long. After a few episodes I couldn't care less if they succeeded or all got blown up. That is always my rule of thumb - if I stop caring about the characters, I'm out. There's no artistic merit, lots of silly scenes that make no sense, and a lead character who is meant to be creepy and chilly but instead spouts nonsense without any insight.

Clearly, there were ideas ripped off from Inside Man. Watch that instead. Clive Owen is brilliant!

Should have ended in Episode 4!"	0
1	Really great Series for Making a Spoof. Somebody Please make a SPOOF.	"I bet if someone makes a spoof of this series, it would be really great and would serve the series some brains which apparently the series does have or don't want.

Looks like, the prof is the grand dad of our Rajnikanth :-)

n btw 2 star for their marketing in Netflix."	0
1	Season 4 is terrible	This show started with a more intellectual approach and it was different and interesting, season 4 is terrible imho. Road runner cartoon is based on true events, when compared to this one, sorry.	0
10	Love it	Memorable characters, strong acting, very thriller, make you feel happy.	1
4	Utterly idiotic!	Not worth the hype. Just save your time by not watching it.	0
1	A very good show for prepubescent teenagers, that's about it!	Bad acting, full of nonsense, idiotic...this is the perfect example of a show that takes its audience for fools...and the fools ask for more! Next.	0
2	2 good seasons only	The rest of the seasons i.e 3 & 4 are so bad. Together with it being a soap opera it is not worth any praise at all. If you dont believe me watch it.	0
1	Netflix VS Art	"This mas an art (1-2 seasons), then came Netflix, with its stupid regulations and destroyed the series.

I intentionally came back, to change my review from 8 to 1.

This is what Netflix doing with the industry."	0
1	Rubbish	I don't get it why robbers are hereos in Spain. All policeman's are criminals and people who is doing robbery are innocent. First season was interesting but later was to much love and drama.	0
3	What	Third and fourth season are one of the worst thing I've ever seen. The first two season were not good but watchable but the third and fourth are just garbage.	0
8	Good enough to watch	It's a good one.. in ending of every episode it has a turning that's the way it create a more suspense in the all over series...	1
9	I'm glad this ended in a train wreck	I was so addicted to this show, it was all I could think about and I didn't want it to end. It's a straight up masterpiece..... But season 3 and 4 start going down hill and I'm glad or I would just be more mad that the show ended. Since it slowly became bad, the more I was ready to let go of it. Kind of like a break up in a relationship	1
4	Starts off being kinda fun, until...	"The first few episodes are engaging and clever enough to hold your interest, but it very soon spirals into complete idiocy. By the end of Season 1, it's hard to care anymore, so we FFd through each episode of S2, just to see what happened. It wasn't worth it.

Bad Soap Opera plotlines, impossibly incompetent police, just unwatchable."	0
1	I hate you people	Why kill so pretty girl she deserved better. I want her back! NOW	0
9	General opinion about the series	The series is very good the more great the first two seasons, great story great characters but the third and fourth seasons are somehow unnecessary, simply the second part of the story is a cliché of the first part of the story with almost the same elements, but I definitely recommend everyone to look since I'm sure that no one for years will surpass the phenomenon this series has caused among viewers.	1
9	The best SERIES I've ever seen..MONEY HEIST IS love	Money Heist is really awesome...every moment of this series was very thrilling and interesting...Tokyo,Nairobi, Professor and Berlin is my favorite characters in this series....Their acting skills were very deft...I started imagining every character in this movie in my own dreams when i was sleeping ..At last this is a brilliant series... Everyone need to try this in their life...Thanks to the director for gifting such a beautiful Series waiting for season 5...	1
10	The best show!	This is the best show I've ever seen. In love with the Professor. Anyone reading this review, please go and see the show rn!!	1
10	legendary 🔥🔥🔥	Piece of art Very cool, I recommend it to everyone 🔥🔥❤	1
10	One of the best ever	Got excited. Thank you and waiting for the season 5.	1
10	ONE OF THE BEST TV SHOW I EVER SEEN	I love the money heist tv show it is completely different in robbery and existing the plan and I love so much	1
10	Must Watch for this generation, trend setter	Best series in recent times 😍love the way it reveals the suspense, makes you sit in the edge of the seat while watching, worth my time	1

10	Need new episodes daily!!	What an awesome series!! Excellent, exceptional and better than any crime thriller i have ever seen in TV history. Marvellous story and scenes. Goosebumps in every season. 10 on 10	1
10	Wow	"What a great series Best in this Genre.

Must watch."	1
1	One of the stupidest TV shows I've ever seen.	One of the stupidest TV shows I've ever seen. I don't understand how heroes can behave so stupidly.	0
2	Entertaining but utterly stupid	Entertaining unless you think about logic and the behaviour of the characters. I wish I would get a dollar for every time the gangsters pointed the gun at each other. Sometimes I thought, shoot at last and redeem myself from one of these idiots.	0
8	Mind blowing until the 3rd & 4th season come.	The thrill that produce the first 2 seasons are pieces of sublime. Then average 3rd season came, as it can't compete the 1st two seasons with it's moderate direction. Then the worst one, the fourth season. I think that's the exaggerated bad extension of a well finished series.	1
1	PREDICTABLE, VERY PREDICTABLE	There are two shows I started & couldn't go through due to its obnoxious predictability. This show & Blacklist.	0
2	No Realistic	"Stupid tv serious 😂 I feel so sorry on ""Spain Police"" * The head of police department sleeping with stranger who doesnt know much when country is in such a critical situation. 😂 * Most funny thing i noticed is in season 3, ""Tokyo"" is going directly and speak (without any face cover or mask) with the governor of the bank of spain when she already been identified as ""most wanted"" around the world. But no one recognize her face 😂 MONEY HEIST COULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT TV SERIES UNLESS THEY INSULT FOR THEIR OWN POLICE 😂"	0
1	This 1 is for season 4	Season 1,2 & 3 were a blast.. I would give 11 out of 12. But season 4 is a total cartoonish.	0
2	Dont be fooled by rating	The idea was great. My expectation was high. But implementation... such a disgrace. too pity	0
10	Just wow	Awesome webseries ! The acting , story , action , romance everything is awesome you just can't stop watching this web series, in every movement there is a new twist, professor, Tokyo , Nairobi and Denver is just awesome. Loved the show in netflix.	1
10	My only medium of passing time.	Yes,its true that the story and some conversations get a bit lengthy during times but its worth watching and is excellently executed.I love this series and its been my only medium of passing time during this lockdown.	1
9	Amazing Spanish Drama	I would Rate both season 1 and 2 is 9/10 The last episode in season is outstanding No words to describe....!	1
8	Only watched seasons 1 and 2 due to reviews here	Can't understand all the hate tbh, it's a bit slow paced and sometimes a touch silly but it's a great story with some interesting characters and a satisfying ending. What more can you ask for.	1
1	Boring, violent and realistic... A soap opera for teenagers	The original idea is OK, however, it looks more of a bad soap oepra for teenagers. I found it quite irrealistic...	0
10	Ultimate Strategies for Heist	Mannerism of each and every role has been crafted. Salute to Director and Art director. I was amazed with Camera work in the complete series. Music adds the lot of value to Series which is the biggest advantage i would say. Pre-planned and back up plan for back up plans which was amazing skill of professor. Everytime when critical time comes story goes back to flashback where how it got reminded and implanted in team is an amazing art of work. All 4 Seasons are equal and thrilled everytime.	1
9	Most interesting and thrilling web series	This is the most interesting web series I had ever seen . Its fast pace keeps you in every moment . Worth watching	1
1	Season1&2.And it would have been a class masterpiece.	Beginning is solid,it will take you to a thrilling and engaging ride till season2 but later will ditch you and force you.Some scenes are not worth it. The rescue of Tokyo and the escape of the professor from the inspector,the shootout scene when Tokyo gets back inside using the police motorcycle is the worst of them.	0
10	Ultimate experience	I really loved it, Can't wait for the next season to come out.	1
10	Best series that i seen	Everything is good,acters,writer and producer... I love all of acters in this serial and if you dont watch this, i suggest to you watch it and enjoy	1
10	Don't read negative review just watch it.	"I have only one word to say ""outstanding"". I am sure you haven't watch such kind of show in your entire life .it is best and will remain best. Forever"	1
10	Stop complaining.	"This series still thrives. After the whole Netflix thing I still think it's good. Seasons 3 and 4 gave a lot of backstory for the characters and the new heist is insanely good.

Overall this series always keeps me on the edge of my seat and it's very entertaining. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good action packed adventure."	1
9	Watch this straight 4 parts	"Leyenda el professor

Bella ciao bella ciao bella ciao ciao ciao"	1
10	Very good	Mone haist is not a season but also a life learner all the carector is awesome this is master piece	1
10	Absolutely spectacular!!!	What an amazing series best i have seen for a long time	1
10	One of its kind.	It is one of best thriller series ever made which is getting more exciting as it leans forward.The fourth part started with a suspense where a prime character Nairobi being shot with a sniper and it goes on after it pretty well.	1
10	A must watch	It's the best show I've watched in a long time. Adrenaline-pumping, unpredictable, ingenious, philosophical, surrealistic, mind blowing roller coaster ride spiced with passion and dark humor. Can't wait for the 5th season.	1
10	One of the best shows ever.	Easily one of the best shows ever. Amazing writing, story, and always has you on the edge of your seat...Literally.	1
10	AWESOME!!!	I hope part 5 is released soon. We were so sad to see Nairobi go...so unexpected. My partner broke a table he was so livid. We cannot wait till 2021 please get part 5 soon.	1
10	Best series ever	Season 1 and Season 2 = Masterful Suspense-filled television,most exciting series	1
10	Super osam.	I had never watch series like this its osam it super cool.	1
10	Best series ever ........	I am eagerly waitting for the season 5 ....❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤	1
8	S1 is a brilliant master piece	S2 is not that bad, it only has emotion's and drama S3 S4 are only for fan's but still watchable	1
10	Money heist	This has been a real treat! An amazing series, great acting, direction and such a suspenseful story it's really one of the very best I've seen ever. I love heist movies and I just found this one in Netflix and I literally couldn't stop watching through the night. The characters are simply amazing! Don't miss this.	1
10	Awesome TV Shows	Great and Awesome, my no 1 favorite tv show, cant wait for season 5	1
9	La Casa de Papel	"The robbers who don't rob the bank for the printing machine, and the robber leader who dates the chief investigator. In order to perfect the perfect crime, the police find clues again and again and are solved by the ""Professor"". Psychological war, public opinion war, gunfight. It's very nice."	1
10	Amazing.	I cant describe how good this is From the start of season 1 to season 4 its simply amazing. I dont have any words. To all the people who didnt watch, i just want to say you something: Watch the first minutes of the first episode, you will become immediatly addicted. I cant wait for part 5 and 6. Thanks to all the team and actors behind this fantastic master piece.	1
10	Absolute Masterpiece	Just wanna thank all the cast.Actors,directors everyone. Thank you for making me feel this movie.This is absolute masterpiece from the beginning to the end.Its getting sad after some episodes because we saw that our loved characters are gone.And when you remember how they were dancing happy all together and now that we cant get that time back again its just breaking your hearts.	1
10	Glued to your seats	You will not leave your seat till you watch the last episode. It's that good.	1
10	Best thing on Netflix	Comfortably the best TV show on Netflix. Watch! You will fall in love with every City of the team. And enjoyably despise every one in the tent! Perfect show!	1
9	One of my favorite best show..	But season 4 is not that much good..!!!! Bcoz we had lot of expectations after previous seasons!!!	1
10	One of the best shows I've ever seen.	I don't get the few negative reviews I've seen in here. This show is phenomenal. I agree that some stuff are not realistic, but who said this is supposed to reflect real life. This is cinema, fiction at it's best. Some people said that it should've ended after season 2. I personally think that it could have definitely ended with the second season because a full story was delivered in 2 seasons, however, the fact that the writers were able to re-develop a completed perfect story into a new superb one that spanned over 2 extra season is absolute genius.	1
10	Awesome series	Love watching it enjoyed all the episodes 😍 keeps you excited what's coming next.	1
4	Destruction of a great serie	In the first two seasons it was one of the best series I have ever seen, with a perfect number of episodes with an excellent plot that leaves you trapped and with exuberant emotions, until then it had perfect but Netflix turned the next two seasons into something empty and without direction or direction. If you ask in summary of the last two seasons it would be said in a few words and without feeling.	0
10	Simply Amazing and addictive	After a long time I watched something which keep you tied up. You can go off the screen because in every second something is happening unpredictable. Must watch it. Love you all.	1
9	As a fan i would just say Marvelous!	How can i describe my feelings about this tv series.. Sorry i can't. It's perfect in so many ways, maybe there is plot hole may be not, i Don't care. What i care is acting of heist party. They are awesome	1
8	La casa de Papel	La Casa de Papel is a unique tv show. It had a very good first season, the plot was original, the actors were incredible, it was action-packed and high-tension. Now with the fourth season, it's still good but not quite the same. A lot of plotholes that don't add up and 2 seasons left in a cliffhanger just to make you wait for yet another season to probably end up like that again. It's good, don't interpret me wrong, but it doesn't have the same quality as before.	1
10	It s the best!	The director of the film is a genius and best actors	1
9	In Spanish just perfecto	One of the best series in all formats, usually series like this can't bind people for long time because it's like same story in all series 'Heist' BUT.....my friend this series is just different you will see robbers as Hero's. Each character is just perfect what they are assigned to do. The strategy, planning, the way professor explain everything it's execution all are just perfect. Professor- A man with dream and principal Tokyo- A girl who react on her instinct and just live the way she is Berlin- best character in season 1	1
10	U will loose control	Don't start watching it unless u r off work the flowing day , I binge watched it non stop and went to work with my sleepy eyes	1
10	Asombroso	A friend of me told me to wactch this series but i didn't thought thought that i will be an incredible and must watch type series,when i started watching it i became addicted because of the story,character and directional perfection.I u want some thrill,amusement and real fun then must watch this.	1
10	La Casa De Papel- A True ART!!!	First of all I don't know why it is called Money Heist whereas La Casa De Papel means Paper House!! Anyways coming back to the series, It's not just a series it's a true ART with perfect cinematography,screenplay,background music,story and directing!! Every actor did their parts flawlessly and you have to focus each and every second so attentively because every scene has meaning and connected to back when planning was done with the present scenario where robbery is happening!! You will be hooked each and every second of it trust me!!	1
9	Its a must watch series	1st part and 2nd part was awesome, i have never seen like this and the professor is just awesome but after 3rd part its just nice but lacks. Overall great series, recommending to all.	1
10	Perfection!	"Everything about the series is very thoroughly planned and thought-through. It keeps you on your toes, guessing, and engaged. Excellent character development. Very layered plot. Sends very clear message. Great writing (with what I can understand thought the subtitles). There's drama, romance, action, and some comedy. Plus, my brainy friends, you will be pleased with the game they brought to the table.

Everyone I recommended this to ended up binge watching it."	1
9	Bella Ciao	Great series but not quite realistic. Professor character was the best thing about this show his tactics and ideas are almost equal to Michael scofiled from prison break. Intelligent yet little bit flawed. This show is emotional, intelligent and best Spanish series of all time.	1
10	One word---- WOW	"I just love and support their point of view.""just wow"" the every seconds from the first episode of season 1 to the last episode of season 3.#bela_chao"	1
10	Wow!	La casa de papel is just amazing! I love the series where you think it has reached it's peak, but it just keeps on getting better and better and better. I was stuck after watching the first episode, and it's just amazing, not really much more to say. I have recommended this to every one I know and I've watched it two times myself. Love it!	1
8	It would have been perfect ending at season 2	Seasons 1 and 2 are one of the best TV series of the least years. Pity, though, they decided to do season 3. As it often happens in successful TV series, the story goes on an on, even though it makes no sense. Screenplays are poor, as sadly happens in Money Heist season 3. What a shame having spoiled a great story.	1
10	Best Thriller I've seen.	Watched it for 3 times. Can any one suggest me other series like this one.	1
10	One of the best heist series in tv history	I loved it. Amazing planning and direction . what a great role played by each individual characters and I like it too much. Berlin's role was awesome. Must watch series.	1
8	Mind blowing and game changing	After watching the part 1-2 i thought part 3 will be boring. But surprisingly part 3 is just game changing superb. I just loved it. Hope part 4 is coming soon. Waiting for it...	1
10	Best TV I've seen in a long time	When I realised it was a Spanish series dubbed into English I almost switched off. What a mistake I would have made. It's a gripping storey very cleverly told.	1
10	Awesome Series	I truly love this series. It's a cross between Ocean's Eleven and The Magnificent Seven with so many subtle messages of the common people against the establishment.	1
8	One of the best thriller TV show	This show keeps everyone on the edge of the seats. Sometimes it's become really cliches but overall an amazing show. The bgm is freaking amazing, one would instantly fall in love with it.	1
9	Mind blowing	One of the best series I have ever watched. The great story plot and the great presentation.	1
10	Bella Ciao	I just loved it. Favorite character Nairobi Berlin professor Tokyo	1
10	Excellent show	Excellent show, very interesting scenery. Everything is Fantastic.	1
10	The most perfect tv serie	"Cant wait for the season 4 !!!

Could someone tell me when is expected to release the season 4?

PS You're the best"	1
10	My opinion	Wow Wow what can I say about this creativity ... Now we can say that Season 3 is the strongest and most beautiful season in the series	1
10	This series is totally gorgeous and one of the best series	"One of the best serious far better than many other TV series. Professor gave justice to his role. What a legend. You'll get addicted to the show.

It's unpredictable, it's suspenseful, it's twisted, it's AMAZING!

screenplay is brilliant. overall is great. love this season."	1
10	Incredibly entertaining	Very entertaining and exciting. Great characters, great acting and superb, action-driven plot. Even the dubbing is fantastic, it is so well done that arter a minute or two you forget it is not an English-language show.	1
8	Blockbuster	Hollywood no longer hokds supremacy in top thrillers. Excelente piece of work!! Though 8 chapters of series seem a bit short. Hope they don't wait that long for Another season	1
10	Probably the best tv show	I enjoyed watching GOT but it wasn't this great at the end! I mean I literally couldn't take my mind off this show! the action, the heist, the crew the roll it was thrilling breath taking!👏😍	1
10	Excellent	Can't wait for part 4 You must see this show right now!	1
10	Season 3 is a masterpiece	"Everything is so well synchronized, direction, scenario. Once.you start watching you cant stop. The best of the best I have ever watched so far.

Bring us season 4,5,6,7 nowww!!!"	1
10	One of the best heist series.	All the performances are superb. Especially the professor.	1
10	Loved it!!	One of my favorites. It's a must watch I have watched this series more then once	1
10	Hats off!	This is a piece of art every movie lover wants to watch. It has all needed in to watch endlessly-narrative, plot twists, love, betrayal, humor, phrases ready to quote. Characters so well depicted like you know them and you want to be your closest friends. I can't stop watching and so afraid it will end soon.	1
9	I love it!	One of the best TV-series I've ever watched. So well thought out and just completely amazing. Left me with a feeling of happiness and curiosity. I want to know what happened after everything! I'm astounded by the creativity, truly a work of art!	1
10	Great tv show overall but the ending was a bit off	This is the first time I'm writing a review here because with all the buildup and the character development that was done throughout the show the ending pissed me off so much. Everything in the show was mastered to perfection with very little plotholes and the ending was good as well but I kinda expected it from the start. With the way the show was progressing, I expected much more from the finale. But overall a great watch a d would definitely recommend it!!	1
10	Finished watching this. What do i do with my life now???	THE BEST! Its a materpiece. Loved all the characters. Wish it never ended. But sadly it had to end.	1
9	A movie it's a movie	I simply don't know how some adults don't understand that a movie it's a movie....expecting facts 100% like in real life...wow...	1
10	Fabulous series! A must watch!	I usually don't review any movie or series, but this is one of the series which made me binge watch, and at last the gave the feel of satisfaction of watching an amazing series, I would recommend it to everyone! A great story, great direction, on point, there might be a few loopholes, but who cares! It's just fabulous	1
10	Exciting	This is one of the best shows i've watched for a while. The storyline is very well written, very exciting. Also the acting is great. Just watch it!	1
9	The best Tv show to come out since Breaking Bad	A great tv show for every one who likes Drame and Action	1
10	If I could give it a 11/10 I would.	Very tight script, little fluff. Original idea. Great ensemble of characters/actors.	1
9	tellin ya right now, you need to watch this	"I'll admit this show took a minute to get me really invested at first, but by the end, I was really attached to the characters and loved all of them (even Berlin). The actors are all amazing and the script was incredibly written. This show is unique and constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat with the ""plot twists"" and whatnot. I promise you won't be sorry if you decide to watch!"	1
9	great series	Once you start viewing it you cannot stop watching- Good storylines. Well directed .	1
9	Realy good bid .	Good soundtrack , good brain plain from leader and well waiting for s3 really good :)	1
10	It's Fantastic, Excellent and a Must Watch	A must watch if you're in an adventure for a Lifetime, if it would be possible I would rate it 20/10 ,it's that Great, One of the Best Series I've seen in a Long Time	1
10	Awesome.	Everything covered. Season is fire. Outstanding, fantastic, fabulous, everything.	1
9	SO GOOD...	This show is just amazing. The star cast , the story, the background music everything is just perfect. You won't see a better edge of the seat thriller than this. It's even better than prison break.	1
9	La casa de perfecto	Twists and turns. Action and drama. Love and be loved. Hate, and still be loved. This story has almost everything. OK, a few unrealistic moments. I mean - how many rounds does a magazine really hold? And how bad are trained snipers at hitting a target? That, and a few unlikely turn of events (which I will not spoil for you) aside - this is a magnificent story, accompanied by brilliant acting! Please give me more of this!	1
10	Fantastic	Superb mystery... Mystery unsolved 😎 Each and every charter unique and surprised each Evey episode....	1
10	Immaculate tv show	One of the finest piece of art. Cinematography , plot , acting all were amazing.	1
10	A masterpiece	One of the best series ever containing action scenes and lots of philosophy quotes being said, I fully recommend you all to watch this masterpiece at least 2 times	1
10	One of the best series i have ever seen..	I dont want to give info about the series.. I suggest you 100% to watch this series.. just do it.	1
10	Amazing	An AMAZING series ! I liked it alot , wish it was more the 2 seasons	1
10	European	"Top ! More ""European"" : That's why it was the most-watched non-English language series ever on Netflix's streaming service !"	1

10	Amazing Experience	"It's not just another ""Netflix Original"" series, is an experience that you hardly skip..."	1
10	AMAZING!!!	One of the best shows I have ever seen; great acting, unbelievable writing, very single aspect of this serie is truly amazing; the first episodes are a little slow, but throughout the rest of the episodes you find yourself involved in the great suspense and you just can't stop watching. Truly, a master piece.	1
10	Best Show EVERRR!!!	I wish I could watch it for the second time like the first time!!	1
10	aman aman	Dayi bu ne aman aman bulasmayin dikkat edin bagigmlilik yapar uyutmaz	1
3	this show is a JOKE	"Completly amateur ... hollywood corny style ... side stories that as nothing to do with the main story 2 or 3 first episodes are ok (or not ...:D )

congratulations to Berlim ... the best character in the show !!

If you want good shows watch ""The americans"""	0
10	One word: Amazing!	Great plot. Suspense that keeps you watching till the end. At every turn you see a perfect plot to rob a money making place. The plan is perfect. Everything is carefully planed and the Professir thinks of it all. You've got to watch it. The performances are great! The character building, the relationships they build while in captivity. Just awesome! Watch it! You won't be disappointed!	1
9	One of the best TV shows on Netflix!	It is simply one of the best TV shows I've watched on Netflix! There are a lot of people complaining that this movie is overrated, but I wanna ask you, which one is overrated: Money heist or The Black Panther?	1
10	One if not the best TV Series ever!!	Season 2 can even be better then T1!! Tremendous Hollywood improved TV Series!! Amazing	1
10	Absolutely breathtaking!!!!!	I fell in love with this show. The acting, the casting, the sets, the passion, the message, everything was perfect. One of my favorite shows ever.	1
10	La mejora serie los últimos años	La mejora serie los últimos años! Me encanta esta serie ! Es muy original! Vale la pena	1
10	Best series ever.	Drama, comedy, thriller, action, romance. All in 1 series, straight forward story, no useless episodes, keeps you sticked to the screen all along the 2 seasons. I wish they do an 3rd season.	1
9	Paper Thin Economy	This series gave me the same kind of KICK that Narcos gave...except for some dragging movements which can be skipped. Few parts were boring like the planning of hostages to escape which can be avoided by fast forwarding. But overall a Good Series. One more series which helps us to understand how the Economy is Paper Thin.	1

10	The best series in history	It has nothing negative, it is uniqueIt has nothing negative, it is unique It has nothing negative, it is unique	1
8	Thoroughly enjoyable	"Briefly, I really enjoyed this series. I finished the whole 13 episodes in two days!. When is the 2nd year coming out? The main drawback(minor one) was the dubbing. Some voices did not match with the characters. I found Birlin out standing as well as the Professor. How I wanted them to succeed(well that was the whole idea as per the professor)

Remindes me of The David Baldachi book called 'The Winner' I was rooting for the bad guy!!"	1
8	It is good.	Well, for me la casa de papel like a roller-coaster, of course first 2 season was epic, and then it started new season, I thought like everybody it was so unnecessary story but we went deep to characters and today I finished 5x5 episode and I said only 'shiii... Noooo, omggg, nooo'. I am in shock. I didn't expect that... And one of the best episode in last 3 seasons.. I don't wanna give the spoiler but I will miss some characters really.. Till December i don't know what I do..	1
10	Amazing	Never disapoints, love the story line and the actors are amazing!	1

10	The best series in the world	Very beautiful and enjoyable money theft series! I just wish the time for the second part of the fifth season of the series was not so late.	1

10	This is the best TV series I have ever seen	"This TV series contains stories of intelligence.

There is a friendly relationship with all the characters here."	1
10	Money Heist	"I love to watch Professor. If professor die or lost robbery of season 2. I swear i never will watch this series next seasons. Professor is the life of this Web series.

I watched professor only. No doubt all characters are acting very good and story and direction is very impressive.

Love from India."	1
8	Good	"This series season 1 2 was fabulous, even 3 4 was good but some grip was not there in the story.

Anyway, I enjoyed the series."	1
1	Overhyped garbage, that insults your intelligence.	"I was baited for this show purely because of the hype my friends made around it.

Started watching it and although it had promise,the story started spiraling down dramatically.

Its like other reviewers have already said, it Spanish melodrama, disguised as an action thriller.

The story was just completely stupid. Forced myself to complete 2 seasons, and that was it."	0
8	Marvellous...Just 2 issues: Beyond Limit Dirty Language in Hindi and Human Nature (Always Talks about Sex)	Marvellous...Just 1 issue: Beyond Limit Dirty Language in Hindi and Human Nature (Always Talks about Sex). This Psycho Nature's People and Dirty Language is so limitless that even I cannot watch it with my Wife. Sometimes Boring Conversations. Otherwise it is 10 out of 10.	1
10	Suspenseful	This Netflix series really deserves to be watched! The cast, story and suspense at the end of each episode is just so entertaining.	1
3	The first few episodes were good	I started watching this with high hopes after seeing some positive reviews on FB. I'm sorry to say that the first episodes are good, but you really have to suspend any sense of reality after the 3 rd episode, season 1. I stopped watching after season 2.	0
10	Best series,	Music of this series and the acting of the actors specially pedro alonso is best and the suspense in this series is mind blowing and the story is so perfect	1
10	I love the series	I love this series. But this series concept came from movie Inside Man. Starring Denzel Washington. Director Spike Lee 2006.	1
10	Never watched a tv show like that!	This show is just a masterpiece like it so much every scene is so interesting. never got bored for a second !!!	1
10	Best Series Ever	I am 54 y/o and this is by the far the best TV series of all time. The writing, the characters, the plot, the twists is all fantastic. I didn't realize that it has already been 4 seasons. The episodes all just blended together so seamlessly. But I am very much anticipating I guess the 5th season when it come out in 21'.	1
1	Worst web series not fulfill expectations	Not fulfill expectations worst experience....worst web series i ever seen.....must watch ocean 11,12,13	0
10	Highly Addictive!	Let's make a cocktail, ingredients: action, romance, politics, police, camaraderie, friendship, betrayal, fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, a smart plot, memorable music, superb acting, amazing writing, people's resistance, dreams, remorse, happiness, money, thrill, love, emotion, passion, stupidity, brilliance.. let's call it La Casa de Papel. The best cocktail you might ever have, utterly delicious... but be careful, it's addictive, highly addictive!!	1
9	Loved it!	Loved the characters and the ethical dilemmas of good and bad. Looking forward to Part 5.	1
2	Completely stupid from the word go	Do you need to create a cringe fest like this to spread your communist propaganda ?? Communism is a failed theory, why the hell do you need to create something cringe and celebrate an outdated, failed theory ?? Watch the dark Knight rises, the same kind of people who are shown as heroes here are shown as villains there, because they hold a stupid idoelogy....	0
2	Awful. Not sure how it has 8+ stars	"Spain clearly doesn't get much Tv.

Gave it 2 episodes and was falling asleep"	0
3	I had high hopes..	The trailer was intriguing, the user ratings suggested it would be good, but but but.. it just wasn't. I didn't care for the characters or the back stories, I got bored and quit after episode 4. Shame.	0
10	most addictive tv show	Most addictive tv show i have seen so far. First episode would not give u any clue as to what the viewer is in for. Great series. Brilliant cast and production. Underlying story tells you to prepare for unexpected in any situation. How one should assume and predict next cause if action.	1
10	Watch until season 2	Watch until season 2 which is 10/10. However, season 3 and season 4 specially go downhill pretty fast with a lot of unrealistic elements. Avoid them at all costs.	1
10	This a masterpiece. Kindly dont go by the negative reviews.	The professor, he will keep your mind twisted and you'll love his acting. Hype comes from the uneasy atmosphere and one of the finest actors that this series has. Please go by the Meta Score. This series is a masterpiece in real. Waiting for the 5th season. Kindly watch and decide. Never ever trust fake reviews. The show kill keep you on the edge of your seats.	1
10	Best thriller web series	I love the whole planning of professor.If you start watching this series you can't control yourself to watch the end.	1
10	Addictive!!!!!	Well, what can I say..... Absolutely loved this. It's exciting, thrilling, romantic, fun. Loved it so much. Binged watched it all in lockdown and so sad I'm at the end of season 4. I have recommended to so many people. You have to watch it. Yes it's lipsinked but u get used to that. Fantastic 10 out of 10.	1
10	The best tv series spansih ever see !	This is my first best ever spanish tv series watched !! All characters well played, great sroty and can't wait to see season 5 !!	1
10	Masterpiece!	This show is absolutely fantastic. I can't believe it almost only had 2 seasons, thanks to Netflix it got picked up again. It really keeps you on your toes the whole time. Acting and writing are marvelous. Going back and forth between past and present is not confusing in this show, like in some other shows. Do watch it!	1
10	You either love or hate it!	"I loved it. Couldn't believe how good this was. Again this isn't real life. It's just fiction so some of these reviewers bursting a blood vein should really just chill the heck out!

A very intelligent show, entertaining, easy to watch and relatable - exactly whats needed during this lockdown.

I absolutely loved it. Very good production."	1
10	The best,after braking bad	The best series after breaking bad. I love all characters.	1
10	What makes a series great?	"To achieve greatness in the series industry you have to keep your audience hooked. Well, this show does this 100%. it is true that seasons 3 and 4 have some ""holes"" in the plot. Who cares. They are still, pure entertainment! If you are haters who try to find mistakes and have ready a negative review before even watching the show, please watch something else. Don't waste our time..."	1
10	Excellent Series	The way of story written and screeplay is just awesome,actors given their best perfomance on the screen❤.I like Berlin character ❤❤	1
9	A Brilliant, Intense, Complex Crime Thriller!	I absolutely love this show, great acting, amazing characters, and a great story, I honestly just love it:) If you are looking for a good crime thriller, then this is definitely a good pick.	1
10	This series is a masterpiece	Lately, I have not seen anything like it. Great series, dynamic, cheeky.	1
8	Love the robbery and the title of the show	Great show and easy to follow Lot of foreshadowing if you focus enough	1
9	The intelligence is here	But the problem is, the robbers can't make this better however they have a mastermind professor. Always they made mistakes and unnecessary violence in themselve (looks like they don't know each other for a while), every time the just put the robbery in danger, they can't work together like a team. which is really awful from netflix.	1
10	This series is an masterpiece ever..	All characters are very precious.. all planning and minor works perfectly worked.. salute the directors and actors..	1
9	La Casa de Papel	I like this kind of high intelligence crime, but the logical end result should be that robbers have been disintegrated one by one, professors' indecision has also killed themselves, and the later resources and information of robbers are far less than that of police.	1
9	La Casa de Papel	The arrangement is refreshing and has a very stable rhythm. Although many unimportant plots have been inserted for the needs of the series, it does not damage the whole. The real human nature promotes the trend, which is both lamentable and regrettable.	1
9	Amazing	Totally worth it ! I suggest to see it, acting, writing and the plot is fantastic	1
9	Getting Better and Better	I have to start off by saying that I don't understand the bad reviews for the fourth part. Sure, there were some questionable scenes, but nothing that the other seasons did better, in my opinion. The fourth part is really intense in his own way and sets itself apart from the rest of the seasons without taking away from the original concept and visualization of the show. I enjoyed watching every part and I hope it continues soon.	1
10	They got it right this time	Once in a while Netflix gets it right, I was putting off watching this show for quite abit, because it didn't looking appealing but and when I finally started gaddamnit I couldn't get enough. Give it a try you will not regret it. 😉	1
10	Superb!!!	Superb!!!Very well made show.Acting is just absolutely amazing!!! Some plot holes and illogical things do not prevent it to be one of the best tv shows ever made!	1
9	Season 4	"Part 1: Excellent Part 2: Outstanding Part 3: Average Part 4: Magnificent.

Season 4 of 'La Casa De Papel' (aka 'Money Heist') Goes Bigger, Louder, and Even More Melodramatic. 🇪🇸"	1
10	Best series	Its one of the best series in the world if you want something shocking then just go for it	1
10	Marvelous!!!!	Season 3 and 4 are just phenomenal. The last two episodes of season 4 are gripping and intense! Professor never disappoints us!	1
9	BINGE..!!	If you watch one episode.. Without your conscience you'll tend to go marathon mode..!! Bella ciao Bella ciao...!!	1
10	Its an amazing series to watch	La casa de papel is one of the most entertaining tv shows i've watched In my life. Its not fiction but its not non fiction.It is believable but not really possible and that makes the tv show interesting. Its intense but it can get very slow too.	1
10	Incredible show I have ever seen	Money Heist is not a story of heist only but it connects you to all the grounds of your life. Alex Pina you are a great writer with a great intellectual power. The characters and the story in which we will see everything drama, action, adventure, romance, thriller, mystery..... and many many more things. Money Heist is my all time favourite TV Show and I am very grateful to Alex sir who created such a premium class TV show for us	1
10	Marvelous series	Professor and his team has played a superb 👌 role in this entire series. Truly recommended series for them who is going to see reviews based series.	1
10	Excellent series 👍	I love to watch, perfect entertainment and what a story with excellent actors I love them all	1
10	I am in love with this show	I am in love this show. It is marvellous and P4E7 OMG! Just love it	1
10	Amazing	This show is amazing. didn't think it was possible for a series to be as intense and as touching as this one. there are so many unexpected plot twists and each episode always brings the viewers to the edge of their seats.	1
1	Messy Heist	"A bunch of badly assembled crooks led by a so-called ""professor"" team up to carry out an improbable billion dollar heist."	0
10	Best and Avesome!	This Tv Show is really cool. The first Spanish TV Show that really got me! Applause, good work.	1
10	Amazing	The twisting of allegiance between good and bad is complicated by not knowing who is good or bad. I hope the open ending means there is more to come and I like the direction of the social/political confusion.	1
10	Masterpiece!!! (Must Watch)	Masterpiece of tension and release, goosebumps, heartbreak, grandiosity and intimacy!!!	1
9	LOVED IT	Fascinating development of the key characters. Fantastic script with superb acting.	1
10	Wow	This is one of the best series I've ever seen. So intriguing so I couldn't stop watch it 😅 Good acting from everyone involved, wonderful characters. The more episodes you watch, the more you'll love the characters. And it has hilarious moments. A series in my taste 👌🏼	1
8	money heist 8-10	I looked at the first two seasons in one breath! I started to watch the third one and didn't even understand what they did! The film was shot just monstrously! Everything is tightened! They play badly! Dialogues are uninteresting, all artificial, including emotions. I quit watching 4 episodes.	1
10	Best series	I got hooked up from the first ten minutes. The series I think in the best one I've ever seen and I'm a big fan of TV shows. From the cast, directing, storyline, even to soundtracks, everything is perfect. The mind games are incredible. This show is 10/10 for me. I Can't wait for what's gonna happen next. So recommend 😍	1
10	Must watch!	Amazing unwrapping of the story, keeps you on your toes	1
2	Is this the best?	I've stayed with this series through till the 2nd series. It's potentially a good storyline thats been squandered by a poor script and some seriously amateur acting.	0
8	The series is great but the sub titles.	If you watch in English and the sub titles are on, you can have a good laugh as they are truly terrible. However, thus far, episode 6, it is an interesting and clever watch. I am sure there will be more thrills and twists	1
10	Mind-blowing	It's absolutely mind-blowing,outstanding,overwhelming tv series I've ever watched 🖤	1
10	MIND BLOWING	"Not into robbery movies but this one is BLAST !!!

Love from Pakistan ;-)"	1
10	Amazing	"I love the whole cast, the story, the acting, simply everything. It's exciting, heartwarming, funny, sad,... u feel everything xD

It's really a must see tv series!"	1
10	First 10/10	This tv series Deserves an oscar. Best narration best directing best Cinematography best story. It's full of empathy, aggressiveness, intense. I never get bored while watching this series amazing.	1
10	One of the best series I've seen in a while	A true masterpiece. Everything about this series is great !!	1
10	El profesor	Part 4 Quickly please Parte 4 Rápidamente por favor	1
10	Watched the whole thing in three days	We need season four, the concept of this series is awesome and it executed so well. I was always standing on my feet at the end of each episode.	1
10	One of the best i have seen yet	Nothing bad to say about a masterpiece.The most suspenseful series i have seen in my life , it's truly mind blowing to me how hard was to predict what was going to happen.An amazing experience that you can't miss out even more if you got bored of the hollywood type writing.	1
10	Best series EVER!!	I love it!! Especially season/part 3, I always want to watch more because it always has you at the edge of your seat. It's really a masterpiece!! I recommend everyone to watch it!!!!!!!!	1
10	Excelent	One of the most interesting tv-shows Ive ever watched	1
10	Brilliant Masterpiece!	Best Heist Series i had ever seen...when the storyline, screenplay, execution, casting and direction falls in place u get such masterpiece!	1
10	Intense	Every episode is exciting and some real good performance by many of the cast.	1
4	8+ rating is not justfied	If one wants to learn how to NOT overact or go over the top, this one is for you . It has got its moments but Tokyo and Arthro take the award for overactive of the century..	0
10	The best on NETFLIX!!!	No other series has so much action, twists and turns, suspense & character development. You think you've figured it out, but surprise after surprise after surprise makes you obsessed with binge watching until the very end! Just finished it and feel like watching again!!!	1
8	Usually hate heist movies!	I'm not the sort of person who enjoys heist storylines and I fell asleep while watching more than one Oceans movie however I found this series to be more than a bit gripping though I'm not sure why. I'm not a major fan of the main character or her destructive romance and I think it requires a major suspension of belief to imagine anyone pulling this off ,but once you do suspend belief this series carries you along with it and you find yourself hoping they succeed.	1
10	Chao chao chao	A truly masterpiece! The direction was phenomenal and roles were perfectly done	1
10	Best tv series till yet !	A pure thriller.. felt like I was a part of the heist 🤣🤣 a must watch . .	1
10	Veeery good!	Especially the second season - very good! Keep me under pressure all the time!	1
10	Mprabo!	Greece love la casa de papel!Eyxaristoume! After game of thrones my favorite is this one	1
3	If i had the time ...	"If i had the time i would do a number of questions about the stupid things that this show have ...

let just remind me one or two ...

1 - So the old lady has Alzheimer ... she forgets everything .... expect that her daughter went to bed with the professor !!!! hahahaaha a :D amazing !!

2 - ""Look i have the accident video here on my cellphone !! "" seems like some scene toked from ""POLICE SQUAD"" ... :D ....hahaahhahaha

well i could state more ... but check for yourself !! :)

all the best !"	0
10	Wow!	Fascinating! You can't stop watching. Really intriguing! Great story!	1
10	Spanish series are great	What a great series! I binge watched them for 2 days in roll. It's intense action and very clever made series. I totally recommend it to anyone.	1
10	The best TV series I've ever watched	From beginning to end, this TV show is just a work of art. Viva Spain, and viva La Casa de Papel.	1
9	Very well put together	"I absolutely love how they wrote this show. Maybe not everyone can tell, but the way some of these shots are written out is just pure gold.

Also, the storyline is a beast, with the constant plot twists & the bits and pieces of info coming your way.

I am truly scared that s2 is going to be a stretch, also i do have a lot of faith in these writers. You should really watch this in Spanish, to get your dose of conjo's and puta's!"	1
1	Smoking.. to much smoking	Great series totally destroyed by smoking people every singe minute.	0
10	Loved it	"Ive been so excited and found so much enjoyment watching every single episode. People are confused why others rate it so high, yet I'm confused why your rating it so low. The plot twists, the drama, the storyline, the exticment, theres never a dull moment in this series. Its constantly got me hooked on the screen and I cant look away.

I've never enjoyed a series as much as I've enjoyed this, I have one more episode left and will be going back to rewatch it."	1
10	Best	It is the best web series or best TV show I have ever watched.	1
1	What am I watching?	I WILL say that Seasons 1 and 2 were mediocre at best. I'd rather watch the Maury Show than Seasons 3 and 4 lol.	0
1	Worst content.	One of the worst content i have ever watched.just watched s1.s2 i could not tolerate.	0
1	Overrated	Nothing special, didnt like it at all, almost fell asleep during the first episode.	0
10	Great show showing black lives matter system	"... trying to bring swaths of the public behind you by dramatically showing off a few bad apples in ""the system"", all with the goal of misdirection. They are a bunch of robbers that have killed and terrorized the public, using the cloak of Robin Hood. Very well made and so timely to show how easily we are all manipulated!"	1
10	A must see...Pure genius	"Who could ever think of mixing music, love, hatred, money,suspense,killing and make such an intensive emotional concoction which makes you never want an episode to end. Before this show, I was like ""a show can't come near to prison break"" but nope..this one is as great as prison break and maybe even better(for some)...the only flaws is that..their seasons are too short...I finish 1 season in 1 day of binch watching."	1
10	Each and every second counts !!!	Don't worry about other useless reviewers ... each and every episode is nail biting , edge of the seat thriller ...one of the best shows ever ...!!! People might try to reduce its popularity just cos it's not American made 🤷‍♂️	1
10	Maybe best series I have ever seen	I have no idea why this series isn't even rated above 9. It's one of the few series where I never even feel like checking my phone. And where I feel I know everyone in the series. It's a masterpiece I hope never ends.	1
10	A masterpiece	Amazing show really interesting not boring at all but season 4 wasn't quite amazing needs s5 to be really good to get back at the track	1
10	Fantastic!	Lockdown has some perks. I binged watched this from start to finish. Brilliant series. Yeh the dubbing is a pain but its better than sub titles. This is one to watch. If ur ever planning on robbing a bank. You mite want to take notes from this.	1
8	Best and worst characters	"Beautiful series without doubt. Twists and turns are convincing. Denver's laugh is infectious and Berlin's style.. wow.

Worst was to see Arturo.. Hated him everytime he came up with same over schemes over and over again. Not sure why he was introduced back after Season 2.

Not sure why everyone was against even punching or hitting if not shooting. Denver is apologising to Arturo for punching him for talking rubbish about son he left. Stockholm is crying because Denver hits Arturo for abusing her. What are these guys..f'in saints or what!? So surreal."	1
10	Awesome Show ,!!!	The best series out there,.... A must watch for anyone looking to watch some good content. Narration is super awesome...	1
10	Perfect series 😍	I feel this movie best and won a lot of awards 😍😍	1
10	Stop The Hate Please..	"Money Heist Is The Great Web Series. Having a Perfect Action Sequences, Suspense, Emotions And A lotttt of Twist As the Story Goes Further.

Season 1 and 2 are Amazing But Season 3 Gets Slow But Last Ending have a great cliffhanger And Season 4 is Slow In Starting But Gets much better, I Don't know the reason why people are hating season 4 I think season 4 is best in action and in suspense."	1
10	Stop being that person.	This show is brilliant and such a massive achievement for the cast and crew.	1
10	All about great	This is one of the century series that you need to watch... Graet suspense from the beginning great comeback. I love it.....	1
9	Amazing show!!	I hope they wouldn't Disturb the Sargio Rachel paradise	1
9	Amazing show, hard to get over	I hope the beauty between Sagio and Rachel would not be spoiled	1
10	Great	One of the greatest television shows I've watched.....	1
10	Best one	Loved all the seasons, curiously waiting for 5!jus amazing	1
10	All time Faviorite Series	I swear that the writer of this series must be 10 times more smarter than PROFESSOR. Everything was so perfectly plotted, that I was not watching but I was also the part of the heist. Season 1 and 2 were the best seasons, but my heart shattered into pieces when my faviorite character died in season 4. I can't wait for the season 5. Because I am constantly having dreams at night about Professor, Nairobi and other characters. This is the first time I am reviewing some TV show, It was fire.	1
10	Love it!	Love the series! The actors are great, the dialogues are often really deep and the suspense is brilliant, especially the forth fourth season. I had my doubts whilst I was watching the third season but the fourth was brilliant! Waiting now for the fifth...	1
9	Getting better in third season	Every season is getting better than the old , well done	1
10	One of the best series	Really great and addicting series , binge watching it is really recommended. It is full of excitement and enthusiasm.	1
10	The best serial!	I hope new seasons come. Some important sequences from the whole story are missing, I mean escapades	1
10	Excellent!!	"The best show I have seen in years! The cast and writer's were amazing, as well as the set!

I highly recommend! I couldn't stop watching!"	1
10	It makes the difference!	I see people saying this the most overrating of all but this one is out there because of it's perfect symbols. La resistencia.	1
10	one of my favourite	Excellent story with excellent implementation. But what I want to emphasize is the acting work. I would like to congratulate all the actor and actress! My favourite scene when Moscow die in the first series.	1
10	Awesome series...	I only upset with part 4, when Nairobi died. I thought that Tokyo should be die instead of her, because she had no kind or respect for plan...	1
8	Was awesome series 1-2	"Today I watched season 4 all episodes (Lot of free time under lock down) but I am disappointed. Series 1 and 2 were awesome and l would give 10 points, this one I'd say 5.

Today after watching season 5 again I'd say that only first two seasons were good."	1
9	Best Series	Truly Awesome and well written and Directed and I want to see the end.	1
10	Really a gud one,	All season are going crazy,hats off to the team,all the best,every single character is unique	1
10	congratulations .	The best series of my days .Incredible i love it very much	1
10	Long live the revolution	A brilliant chess game between the leftist resistance and the capitalist pigs Bella ciao	1
10	Wow just wow	"I stumbled upon this masterpiece on Netflix. Could very well be the best show I have ever seen or at least in the top 3. I'm talking about something as good as shows like ""breaking bad"" for example. I just finished the last episode of season 3 and it left me in awe. I can't wait for season 4. Start watching it today, you won't regret it and you will thank me for the recommendation."	1
10	wonderfull, wonderfull series	If you see this serie you dont shy for watching that, i promis you.	1
10	Speechless	The best of all the series ever, Spanish cinema leads the way to Holywood	1
10	It's the best series I've ever watched,loved it💕	"If I were asked to answer the best series, then it would be 'La Casa de Papel' also known as 'Money Heist'

In addition,the ending was......🙏"	1
10	Amazing	The best TV series I have ever watched in my life. Best with everything..	1
4	English voiceovers destroy this show	English voiceovers destroy this show. The storyline is chaotic to begin with-add in mismatched poorly acted voiceovers, and the show becomes unwatchable. I'm not sure how it has a high rating-perhaps watching the original acting makes all the difference-but I can't see how the often weird and incredibly sexist dialogue or disconnected storyline carry even the original.	0
10	Simply amazing!	Enjoyed with the movie to the maximum!! Really great idea, nice plot, actors are good !! Every episode I watched with a big interest!	1
8	Very nice	Very nice , but the police dosnt use that turn off the lights , why ? It missed some things to be real , but its nice has suspicions	1
10	Money filming	It was not possible to use footage of the real house of currency. the impressions of money were actually made in a newspaper	1
8	Great	The tv show have a great casting and i couldn't stop watching till the end.	1
1	Repetitive story	Too political and i think it's the most boring tv show ever.	0
2	Couldn't go on after 3rd episode season 1	Defeats common sense. Lacks any connection to real life. Characters are out of a soap opera (sorry soap opera lovers).	0
9	Confess	We have to admit that this series will be one of the top 10 series in history.! Like If you agree?	1
10	on par with breaking bad.	Unbelievable watch. blitzed it all within a week.. shame season 5 could be a hefty wait 😬	1
10	Brilliant	Exceptionally brilliant. Completely unpredictable. No nonsense.	1
10	MURALI REVIEW	MONEY HEIST : ONE OF THE BEST WEBSERIES I WATCHED IN MY LIFE IS MONEY HEIST. I BECOME A HUGE FAN OF PROFESSOR. I SPEND 2 DAYS OF 12HRS EACH DAY TO COMPLETE THIS WEBSERIES. NOW WAITING FOR NEXT EPISODES	1
10	Very not boring	Despite some surrealistic scenes I find it almost perfect, addictive for me because its uncommon subject plot. Although you are sure that you can predict actions you just not get bored of this series. Actors, soundtrack, title, plot very uncommon compare to all movies made these days.	1
10	The best series ever	After years, we watch a series full of excitement in great detail , Honestly, I didn't watch the thriller series after prison break and dexter until I came across this series, I would like to thank all the staff of the creators of this series and as a fan, I ask them to continue the series with excitement and strength as in previous seasons And I don't understand those who write critical comments at all....	1
10	Mind-blowing	This show is just mind blowing. Best show ever made. I literally couldn't stop watching. It's soo addictive that one episode is never enough and the plots are just beyond shocking. Masterclass	1
10	Season 1 and 2	Season 4 too much drama. And why nairobi died?? Rio should die	1
10	Binge watched something crazy	"I've given this series a 10. I've only given about 8 of my 150 odd watches a 10.

Well written, great action, great characters, great twists, sexy, violent, bloody, well filmed, high budget."	1
10	Amazing show!	One of the most fantastic and i intelligent series I've ever seen! Also I would like to add the amazing fact that in part 4 they added a transgender person like me so that melted my heart! Well done!	1
10	A masterpiece	Every episode is a masterpiece. More of this serie please ;-)	1
9	With every season it gets even better	I had never ever watch a show that with every season it getting better I really can't wait what is going to happen next	1
9	Season 4 the best so far	Its a good show to watch overall, but season 4 has been by far the best so far, theres more action, more cliffhangers and more suprises than in previous 3 seasons. Cant wait for season 5 to be released.	1
10	Best series in the last 3 years	Goosebumps, exsiting and very good manuscript. Great action!	1
10	One of the best All Time TV Show	I love this show!!! Everybody should see this amazing masterpiece.	1
10	Masterpiece series	Some series you will find such interesting that will change your perception about life and money heist one of them. Such mind-blowing acting by every character of suspense darama thriller script. Must watch if you want good content	1
10	The best series în this moment	The best series so far ... It keeps you always in suspense ... you will always be curious what will happen after you have watched an episode	1
9	Season 3 Episode 4 seif blowing scene, unreal	In the season 3 episode 4 there is a scene where a guy enters in the seif full of water and put's a c-4 to blow a door. Under water, is true that bullets don't travel a long distance, like 1 meter maybe, whit explosive it's anoter story. In that scene the scubadiver is not more than 6-7 meters away from the explosion, in such short distante, if a c-4 explodes, the explosion blast under water will be so big that your lungs will explode from the presure that the blast will make. that's why i'm not giving 10 stars	1
10	Best series. No Hollywood.	I will give almost any Holywood actor for almost any actor in this TV show. And a big thumbs up for the producer! In any idiot american movie, you will get 1000 kills per season and stupid fake drama. But not this one.	1
10	I really enjoyed season 3!	Season 3 did not disappoint. New characters fit in well and keep the acting levels to the highest! One of my biggest fears was that the show would lose its Spanish essence and would try to please international audiences, specially the US market. It happened somehow in the first two seasons, in which some characters, police mainly, talked in a very polished way, far from the Spanish real style. But I must say that dialogues in third season appear more real: rude and full of cursing.... just the way we are.	1
10	The intelligent people will understand	All of you who don't like this series- please go to the gym, stop eating donuts, find yourself some friends and a partner in life. Maybe this will help you to stop being a HATER,who spends the whole day HATINGS great movies because of their miserable life :))) Please get a life , you poor Americans 😢	1
3	Dubbing is just awful	Not a very interesting series at all. It may be good in the original Spanish but the dubbing is so poor and so trite, it really destroys the viewing the experience. I always prefer to just see subtitles rather a really poor job of dubbing in the dialogue. For the most part, the series is very silly.	0
10	Adoro e recomendo! Adoro adoro	Adoro e recomendo! Grande série, grande elenco! Muito surpreendente	1
10	Better than S.O.A or G.O.T. if not dubbed over	Would have been 1 of the best shows to ever have been made!!! Part of me thinks it's even better than Game of Thrones and Sons of Anarchy . I dont think I've ever seen a show that made me move on to the next episode in anticipation of what is going to happen!!!!	1
10	Another Masterpiece!	Best series ever made, next to prison break.. Amazing show, Don't miss this! 10/10!	1
10	The best series I ever seen!	Spanish series over everything it's been by now on theatre! Congrats!	1
10	Recommending to everyone I know!	I absolutely love this show! It's exciting and suspenseful with romance and passion! I can't get the song bella ciao out of me head! So excited for part 5	1
9	AMAZING! Keeps you on your toes!	I don't know why everyine is disliking season 4 so much, I have rarely seen a season of a show be SO entertaining and suspenseful! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Please watch it, it is seriously spectacular.	1
9	Still good	The quality of the plot is lower in season 4 but is still good. Already attached to the characters, so can't stop watching. Season 5 has to be the final season for sure though.	1
10	BEST TV SERIE EVER!!!!	Amazing tv serie! Best of the Best! Haven't watched a movie or a serie like this before and i Do not think that any tv series will be above of this one. Great job and thanks again for this excellent story. Very clever and it is so addictive.	1
8	Very similar, yet a hundred times better than Breaking Bad	I really don't know why breaking bad is more popular than this when these series have a story a lot better.	1
10	The people who do not money heist they deserve movies like student of the year 2	Best web series of my life. I really enjoyed this series.	1
4	dubbed euro-drama	"We couldn't get into it. the timing is off on European films. the dubbing was distracting with conversations like ""coffee is good"", ""yes, I drink it in the morning."", ""yes, I need my coffee, LOL."" SERIOUSLY. couldn't get through the first season."	0
10	Absolutely brilliant	"The plot is amazing, the characters have such great developments and there isn't one boring moment.

The minute season 4 was released I was absolutely hooked. People are complaining about the fact that the heist didn't end in season 4 but I think it gave us much more detail of how even in the most perfect plans things sometimes go the other way.

Gandia is the most annoying character ever but I think he added to the show."	1
8	This Show It's Unpredictable	"The story line is super intense that you won't be able to take your eyes away for one second and it is one of a kind which no detail is left behind, The best thing about this show that it's unpredictable, you can't calculate any moment Which take your mind to dream that what will happen next. Amazing Series, love all the character, Each character has its own value and perfection specially ""The Professor"". This genre is so incredible and you keep falling love with the characters. Truly recommend."	1
1	This series is supporting isralili occupation	This Series supporting IDF as a strongest army in the world , they didn't mind how much pain that may do for Arab and palestinians who is sits under occupation since 1948 without any rights and without any mercy, i was a fan of this series but my beliefs stronger than anything els i like i love my land and i want to live in my home in peace without killing and steeling my land and my home from me.	0

1	Garbage Garbage Garbage	"I've watched a lot of TV series from all genres.

This is the worst series I have ever seen.

Bad acting Bad plot and Bad story.

IMBD you should have a negative star rating."	0
2	Pesimo final de temporada	Pesimo final. Pesimo final. Pésimo final. Pésimo final.	0
1	What kind of hypocrite are they.	"The series shows that they are against bad government, torture but the heroes of the series which is (Darko Perich, Hovik and Enrique Arche) has shown their support to Israel. As a fan, I'm really disappointed about what they did it. It's really shame!

I wandered to them to apologize or retract their statement!

#FreePalestine."	0
1	Its boring	Its boring same story same details its boring that all.	0
8	Perfecto plan	Watched till season 2 Why there is no one dying. They point guns, then situation gets tensed up, and everytime there is decision, let's not kill.. 2 whole seasons and they are still heisting money at same place. Hundred hours stretched..	1
10	Extremely inspiring to organize a heist in RBI	Undeniably, this series has everything takes to fascinate the viewer, every gener as thriller, crime, action, emotional.	1
9	Powerful series	Such a wonderful series is this where you have no time to blink your eyes many of the time you should clapped on the scene powerful performance of actors should deserve all the awards ever aspects of series is outstanding.	1
2	Bad Movie series	Hard to explain but the movie seems to be overrated.	0
1	Bad tv show	They are bad in real life and their tv show bad too. I don't like it.	0
1	Overrated	I don't know why there is such craze for this.this series literally glorify bank robbery and robbers.audience are making these characters, hero's/god. They love watching cops killed, government collapse.	0
1	Repeating again and again and again !!	Repeated brolonged scenes without a real story, claiming that they are freedom fighters but they are just theives, promoting immorality to the youths...etc...	0
1	Should have stopped after season 2	This series is getting worse and worse with every season, it is shooting itself in the foot.. Seems like they are just trying to milk profit out of its fame...	0
1	Don't watch	It became a Bollywood movie after season two, and it's just repetitive.	0
1	Terrible, long, cliche	"Too long. Very expected endings ""Hero always wins."""	0
2	Can this be your over already	Same scene , same plot , overdramatic , finish it off already ..	0
4	This is just for stupid people	Good idea, started promising, but plotholes that make you question the writers inteligence. Don't think to much and you may enjoy it.	0
3	Spent 2 seasons getting rid of...	"Old, sick, and Slavs.

3 stars for camera work and landscapes.

Too much pathos for an unprepared viewer."	0
3	A Heist Of Time	I have no idea what this show rates 8.4 on IMDB. This TV series from Spain and dubbed with American voices is fascicle. There are 44 episode that should have been condensed to perhaps 8 in total. The show is padded with meaningless melodrama and I want to reclaim all those wasted hours back. Don't waste your time, there is much better out there.	0
2	I did not review it because it is not found in full only trailers	None I did not review anything due to no full movies only trailers are found.	0
10	Best web series I have ever seen	Best web series I have ever seen. I love it. Must watch web series on Netflix and I love the character of Tokyo and professor.	1
10	Best of best	"One of the best series.

Watch many times.

And enjoy each of every time when watching it."	1
9	One of the best series	I like the characters and there acting, the storyline line is amazing, the suspense, the thrill amazing.	1
10	An incredible series	I loved this series. On the other hand there is a downside! The end ... Its can't end like its! I hope there will be a season 4 because I am staying on my end ... I find it sloppy! Do you know if there will be a season 4?	1
10	Best Series i have ever seen!!!	"Nothing to say. It's just an awesome series.lots of love for Money Heist.

Love from Bangladesh."	1
9	Awesome show	Nice story line masterpiece show Specially professor acting awesome.	1
9	One of the best series	Till Season 3, it was a masterpiece. Season 4 was little slow but picked up again from Episode 5 and gave a thrilling end. A must watch, good thriller and actions. Waiting for the Season 5 eagerly to see how it ends. But this series deserves a lot more appreciations and ratings, it's not overhyped but a great series.	1
9	This was astonishing!!!	Apart from the fact that the voices don't always match up with the characters mouths, (it was originally in Spanish) it was amazing!!	1
10	Best Netflix Show Ever	Every character of this show is one of its kind i.e. A prototype. Writing, Direction, Dialouges and Cinematography are exceptional. Lastly who can forget the PROFESSOR, the mastermind. Thanks to Netflix for bringing this show in INDIA with phenomenal dubbing. What a Team ! A Dream Team. Hats off to the makers.	1
10	Mind blowing series	Perfect planner Mr. Professor....... You can't even imagine that what move comes next by the professor.	1
10	Hindi Dubbing is awesome.	What a mind blowing web series is this and hindi Dubbing is so cool. I like this web series so much.	1
10	Everything beyond imagination	Phenomenal in every sense. Hats off to the entire team, exceptional direction and screenplay make this a dream to watch. The Professor is love to watch.	1
3	It's boring and dragging	Money heists are supposed to be crisp and fast paced. But this one is a drag with a back story of every character and dragged to 4 seasons. I have watched 11 episodes in season 1 and wasted my time. Its a good plot that's been wasted. Probably netflix wants to make the money that the robbers plan to make in the series from its audience. Just that we as audience have choice to avoid watching it.	0
1	Anything is possible	If it's possible that this kitsch to be evaluated 8.3 out of 10, then would be possible to have Covid-21, Covid-23,......and so on.	0
4	Dissapointing!!	This is maybe the worst concept of a TV series by far. A tiring story about a theft that make Spanish police seem so naive. Morover, it has a lot of references to progressivism and feminism. I wasn't able to continue watching.	0
1	BSDK ke is se Chutiya series nahi dekhi... Bc Time Barbaad BC.	Time Barbaad BC. Chutiya BC gaand me daal lo es series ko Laptop Khraab na hota to moot deta Laptop par.	0
9	Totally time spoil.there r lots of movie like that but it will spoil ur time becoz this web series should be in one episode only	Totally time spoil.there r lots of movie like that but it will spoil ur time becoz this web series should be in one episode only.	1
2	If You're Into Stupid, Unlikable Characters...	"...and nonsensical plot twists, this is the show for you.

By the third show you'll realize there isn't a likable person on the show and wonder why you'd ever root for the robbers. Save your time and don't watch into the second season like I did."	0
1	Watch and give star	"Go watch your self and give ur opinion I watch this and it's too slow S2 is annoying no logic It's just get hype bcoz of the costumes and dali And the character names that's it.

The only episode i liked is the s3 ep1 Otherwise this web series is extremely overrated."	0
1	I hate it here	WHY DID THEY KILL NYROBI WHY TELL ME WHY. THIS DONT MAKE NO DAMN SENSE.	0
8	Season 2 should have last	Season 2 was having a good ending but season 3 and 4 disappointed me but they are also good .But must watch series . Season 4 were having very much flashbacks but I am not disappointed after watching it should have watched.	1
2	Big flop	I think the high ratings are coming from folks that never seen a good tv show. Parts 3/4 are completely boring, non challenging and impossible to understand. Special police defeated by amateurs? I Am good thanks, but no thanks.	0
4	How does this have such a high rating?	"I get it's a foreign film, but the voice over is terrible. Half the characters are so annoying I had to fast forward through parts.

Show drags on way to long. Save yourself the pain & suffering and find a different show."	0
3	No likable characters	If they would just concentrate on the heist and quit showing so much about their goofy personal lives, it would be much better.	0
2	Good but lacks luster	This is a whole disaster of a series according to what i was told by people who said it was the best ever. For me its a big no. Season three and four are the worst. Seasone one and two were awesome. Anyway i wasted some good time watching it i can not even recommended it to anyone.	0
1	If not... A splendid story executed with superb craftmanship	This was created and carefully planned with precision and dedication, skills and love for the profession, executed with superb craftmanship. I do not mean the heist, a well planned coup by itself, I mean the series. 4 seasons, don't bother about seasons 3 & 4, they are just silly follow ups. Still a clear tenner, if not... Yes, regrettably, if not. This is not how women should be portrayed and left behind at the glorious end. Watch and judge for yourself. Now a one star series, one star for excellent cinematic craftmanship.	0
9	Only jealousy says it's over rated	Yes episodes are dragged especially in the 1st season. 2nd season at it best of all, 3rd is okay and 4th is nice at end unless Berlin conversation with professor. So much, nano level planning happens only in reel not in real. Hats off to the writter. still a great come back after 2 seasons where it ends originally. I enjoyed but not all the episodes, you need fast forward unnecessary conversation and romantic scenes. It doesn't deserve 10 but surely more than 8.	1
9	Money Heist Review	The web series was very good, it was a very good website, heart was happy to see it and I did not see such a big robbery, along with that I liked the acting of the professor.	1
9	Good	Very great series. I hope the officials should re-photograph it with a new story	1
9	The best series I've ever seen	Part 1 & 2 were amazing....i really love it...........................	1
8	Its is just brilliant and unique 👌	Actually when i saw the first ep. I thought that will be as always. Bank robbering and some action and that is it. But i was surprised by the drama and the genius plans of Professor. And also i liked how they mentioned lots of big subjects (such us : stockholm syndrom and the relation between police and superior forces like FBI).	1
8	I did not like too much sezons 1-2 and LOVED sezon 3	I have not finished the show yet but wanted to share that I compeletely do not agree with the opinions saying that first two seasons were the best and then Netflix destroyed the show. I think it is totally opposite!!! Netflix gave this show something super important, emotions. Final episode of season 3 was just fantastic.	1
9	I hope the next season	"The series ran for four seasons and thirty-one episodes. This is a thriller released on Netflix. The series leading characters are Alvaro Morte as el teacher, Ursula Corbero as Tokyo, Alba Flores as Nairobi, Itziar Ituno as Raquel Murillo, Jaime Lorente as Denver, Miguel Herran as Rio and Pedro Alonso as Berlin

I really like this series because it feel chill, I binge watched the last season. To my mind it's the best series on Netflix. I recommend you this series, you will really fall crazy about it so you must watch it."	1
1	No need for season 3-4	I think they had to ended at season 2 it was great but season 3-4 was good but not enough	0
3	So funny and stupid	Honestly, this is the most ridiculous series in the world. I've never laughed so hard at such stupid plot twists. You should write that this is a comedy series.	0
3	Starts well but goes downhill	I loved the first season, but it should have ended there. I finally stopped watching halfway in season two as the plot seems to just drag on forever. It seems they have to invent an endless stream of totally incompetent action from the police (and incredible luck for the criminals) to make sure this never ends. Unfortunately a good example of a series that would have been great with 10 episodes but them gets watered out far too much.	0
8	Season 1 was excellent	"Season 1 was excellent,,.......

Second Heist is not convincing....,...........

Okay to watch."	1
8	Great First season	Season 1 was great! But in season 2 they started dragging things out.	1
8	Season 1 & 2 was amazing	They make season 3 & 4 just because of success of 1st and 2nd. If you don't want to regret finish 2nd season and don't watch 3rd and 4th season. Waste of time	1
2	Waste of time	Started promising, but it turns into a stupid soap opera pretty soon. Complete waste of time.	0
4	This TV show seems to be a remake...	"It is clearly inspired on the 2006 film titled ""Inside Man"", the storybook is very similar but the Spanish TV show extends it along four seasons!"	0
4	Too unrealistic	Too unrealistic and immediately fails at the beginning of season 2	0
4	Extrememly well made, but predictable and one dimensional	I really enjoyed Money Heist to begin with, its very well made, but, in the end it just annoyed me. The plot twists are predictable and you end up feeling like you are only offered one choice, to empathise with the gang and if you don't find that you do you may as well turn off.	0
3	Started off promising and progressively got worse	Too much drama, unbelievable characters constantly making stupid decisions or behaving unbelievably stupidly. Season 4 is a total soap opera.	0
4	twice as long as it should be	Good premise, but lacks a watchable plot. I found myself fast forwarding a lot in the last few episodes of season 1	0
3	Height of idiocy by the characters	First two season you can hardly digest. Then they come up other season and the introduction of 3 season is pathetic that you will hate yourself for wasting time watching first two season. If they would have ended tokyos character I would have still seen the the third season. Professor character was perfect until he fell in love jezz come on who the hell does that if you are a master planner.	0
4	Overrated!!	Where does all the hype comes from..its a good show...not one of the greatest..and stop comparong it with breaking bad	0
4	Starts good but soon gets boring and stupid	First two, maybe three episodes were fairly good, like 6-7/10. But 4th and 5th episodes were so boring and full of stupid and illogical decisions that my wife and I found ourselves playing with our phones during the most part of the latter. When it ended we decided to give up on it and look for something better to watch. We totally don't care what will happen in the series and if they escape or not.	0
2	Since season 2 has turned into mindless crap	No logic, no rationale, no research, no science just mindless plot lines. The first two seasons were brilliant. The other seasons could've been masterpieces but it's just turned into a circus with dumb writing inexplicable nonsense. There's so much irrational stuff that you could go on and on about how foolish the scenes and plot devices were. The attention to detail is almost non-existent.	0
8	Great series unfortunately the dubbing is 3rd rate	Money Heist is a great Spanish series and well worth watching. The only unfortunate part is that the dubbing into English is really bad, besides that very enjoyable.	1
9	You won't be disappointed	Pull 2 all-nighters watching this show. It's really good and you won't be disappointed.	1
9	JUST ART!	WOW this is a piece of art! THE STORY is so emotional, and the actors are so real! AMAZING!	1
9	Optimistic Thought	This series is one of the best series i ever seen, the plot of this series is best one and the director put his all thought whether it is negative or positive, the 5 month plan is a appropriate time in which they put their thought and success in there mission.	1
9	Absolutely loved it	"I don't understand what these people want to convey by saying stop at season 02 ,

this is like the Prison Break , 1st season you break out , 2nd season you settle .

like wise this is following the pat , I loved season 3 and 4 as well."	1
9	I'm stopinng watching this at end of season 2	After reading most of the reviews here it is clear that end of the season two is the best point to stop. I think I'm making the right decision.	1
9	Awesome series on Heist	Well it is one of the best series ever made on money heist...started watching the series with my elder brother recommendation...first two seasons were awesome 👌...remaining two were good but lacked the thrill though the planning was brilliant...loved Berlin character much than the Professor (personal opinion)....eagerly waiting for the next season...one extra star since my wife watched with me the first non Indian series...May be the last:)	1
8	Perfect Crime	First 2 seasons redefines perfect crime. Big fan of berlin. Personally feel it should have ended with the second season. Seasons 3&4 didn't live up to the bar raised in earlier seasons	1
9	Fantastic engaging tv series	Watching in 2019 during iso. Engaging and interesting concept. Watched the entire first season in a few days. Just started the second season and it still hasn't disappointed	1
8	Hardcore	The first two season got me addicted! Contains love and emotions mixed with betrayal and strategy	1
9	Ended too soon	Season four is missing a few episodes for it to be complete.	1
9	Intelligence is the new sexy!	I feel like I'm watching a thrilling Hollywood blockbuster. The stereotype of the character professor is not uncommon from previous shows, movies, even novels, but what the show did is focus on details, different stages of the robbery, deep insight of contemplation, countermeasure deployment, plot twists and surprises. The whole show is a close and clear demonstration of dynamic shifts. The rhythm of the show is elastic and tasteful.	1
9	We loved it.	Everyone has different reviews. But my fella and I loved it. Even though it had English voice over. Granted there were a few cringe worthy moments but that's what makes it not run smoothly. Be pretty dull if they made no mistakes. The heist team are great and I have to admit I shed a few tears too. So come on crack on with season 5 we are waiting. Watch it and see for yourselves if you like it or not, if we had gone on the reviews we wouldn't have watched it and we couldn't stop.	1
9	Lockdown binge watching	My cousin was insisting me watch this show from quite some time...and I only got a chance to pick this during this lockdown time, trust me I haven't regretted a bit - such strong characters, well crafted and narrated, you love them, you hate them (Arturo specifically) but you can ignore them... #BellaCiao	1
9	Very good	...except some logic things but it is very entertaining. Good show with more to come!	1
8	Overrated and illogical	The professor should have hired the dive serbians and Moscow and he would have done it in the first four episodes.	1
9	With honors, about the best TV series I have ever watched	I don't wanna give it a 10 cause I dont believe in perfection, but it deserves it, cause despite I was convinced by different people to watch it I didn't wanna bother, since I always thought my own country series were boring, predictable and not worth watching. This series gave me hope to believe in Spanish talent for creativity as a unique trait and I thank Netflix for investing on developing such an outstanding masterpiece. Congrats	1
9	Best web series that I have Watched.	This web series is on a different level. The plot, the logic, the intelligence etc you name it and it's there. Watched all seasons till now, eagerly waiting for the next one.	1
8	Deadly on eyes.	A brilliantly scripted, well arranged series. It's definitely one of the best Netflix has to offer. Especially with the twist in the story-line that goes in favour of both the robbers and the police, this series is really something you can waste time on during this lock down. The last few episodes of season 1 might feel a little slow but you're going to keep watching it till the end until you can finally finish season 2, because that's where things get so wonderfully arranged.	1
8	Criticism	The first two seasons are great. In the third, the entry of American capital and adaptation to the neoliberal audience is felt. Women's rights, gay love woes, paterican sense of justice, all for one, etc .. like a steven seagal movie .... They screwed great series ..	1
9	If you want be a director	Whenever you want be a good director you need to do whatever that cause you have a lot of mind play scenes in your drama . I should say tnx and good luck to sir Pinna You are the best and you did the best with Money Heist	1
8	Brilliant Script	Brilliant script for me as Indian Audiences. I never expected this much twist in same series. Must match	1
8	A wee bit slow and prolonged but still good	I actually really enjoyed this show. They dragged it out a bit but it still gripped me. That said, the final episode drove me nuts. Very non-Hollywood ending, which many appreciate but to my mind it ended on a cliffhanger and so at least one more series is surely coming...please, please, and soon. This is very much a 'lockdown special'	1
9	Beautiful!!	#makaut #actuvity point Beautiful, li'll underrated accoriding to me!! Season 1,2 was building up the story of some people included their head professor for some heist, but later on we get to knew more. People like me always want any movie or series with some good story, drama, love, friendship as well as a thrill. I got everything. Must watch for all..	1
9	Beautiful story telling & full of emotions!!	Kind of underrated web series!! It's beautiful, people like me, who love thriller as well as some drama, emotions, love, cry, hate, fantasy, science infusion. Money heist is definitely for them. For season 1 & 2 I think I can rate 7/10 , because of some extravagant non reality. But for last 2 season, they've worked on it & made things beautiful ..	1
9	Binge worthy series	So far one of the best series to watch. So brilliantly written and executed.This series's theme song is all about the love and ruined. Overnight this show became phenomenon. You won't be disappointed. The only drawback was it sometimes got bogged down in pretty drama.	1
9	Season 4 is amazing! Can't wait for S5!	Nairobi's death reunited El Professor's team. I guess S5 will be more about Alicia. Por Nairobi!	1
8	So thrillingly good then.....	The 1st series is my favourite thriller series ever on Netflix . Quite faultless. Great story , direction , acting and screenplay . You could not ask for more from a thriller . But each subsequent series is not as good as the last sadly and the 4th is just scraping the barrel unfortunately. Its a pity because it began so brilliantly .	1
8	Must watch for sure	Very interesting and must watch. All actors are great. First 2 parts will make you stick to your seats. However 3-4 parts are little saw and few shots you might feel bored. Bella ciao song is used awesomely.	1
9	must watch	"I usually don't love these kind of tv shows but this one... this one is so good! I finished the first season in 2 days cause I just couldn't wait to see what was gonna happen.

the only reason why I am not giving its 10 is because the beginning of season 3 was not as good as I wanted it to be but that is me being extremely critical.

the actors are really good and the plot is just so smart."	1
9	Breathtaking series	All the charectors have justified their roles. Berlin nailed it and professor no need to tell.few scenes has to cropped to replace with better storyline to make it more engaging .	1
8	An engaging series	This series started of as a very engaging and thrilling one. Having lot of twist and turns. There's has been a lot going on in this series which overwhelms you. The pace is also good. Once you start, stopping yourself from binge watching becomes a difficult task. After the second season though things changed a lot. It looked repeatative. After second season creating more series was definitely to do business.	1
8	Its good	Story is good. Somewhere it felt like the plan was too much perfect than it should be.	1
9	Watched it all straight up 4 seasons. Bella Ciao	"What a series, cant wait for the season 5. Leyenda El Professor.

Bella ciao Bella ciao Bella ciao ciao ciao"	1
9	Heist!	One of the best series I have ever watched! There are surprises in almost every episode of the series... All the four seasons are amazing...only the last season I found a bit lacky But it's worth watching....	1
8	Gripping!	"Amazing!!! Extraordinary!! Not enough adjectives to describe this piece of art. It is a must watch. I have watched over a 100 series but never such a gripping one. This isn't even my genre!!! I am hooked. Just started the third season and it isn't anything I ever thought it would be. I am not much of a writer so would just end by saying ""Bella Ciao""!!!"	1
9	Reviewed @ckritique	Check my full review in my Instagram page @ckritique	1
8	Stretched	Heist could end in only one part ..but it took two ..	1
9	Awesome Story	I love the way of story telling. Such a wonderful tv shows. Waiting for next episodes.	1
8	Great	After getting pass the language barrier and focusing in. This is a great show. Has action and makes you want to binge watch it	1
8	It's very nice	"The robbers who don't rob the bank for the printing machine, and the robber leader who dates the chief investigator. In order to perfect the perfect crime, the police find clues again and again and are solved by the ""Professor"". Psychological war, public opinion war, gunfight."	1
8	Love it	Honestly I can't get these bad reviews though I agree that the show could've eneded just after season 2 but come on!! It's thrilling and exciting to watch! I really don't expect anything else from it. It conveys some important messages about the cruppted system though which is well done. But I loved some of the actings, the thrill and anticipation. I watched the whole series while quarantined and it just made it a lot easier. I watched all episodes back to back and I couldn't stop! Don't be too serious just enjoy!!	1
8	What a good surprise	"The first two seasons were indeed astonishing. The 3rd and 4th seasons were also very good but it seemed a little repetitive, I believe that the show was to end after the ending of season 2 but it's success made the producers to go on with it. It's very entertaining to watch and the characters have a lot of personality and are very different from eachother.

It is refreshing to see a non american show with this quality."	1
9	So many feelings!	I was basicaly hooked to 4th season.. Yes there is a few lol moments but no problem at all, great camera, great acting you wont sleep while watching this show.. keep up the good work and thanks for show like that! If you dare i would like to see few more seasons with new actions!	1
9	Watch in Spanish	Super series. So different compared To all these happy end series.	1
9	Love La Casa De Papel	"I really love this show. 1-2 seasons are ""la bomba"", 3-4 are good. You can't stop watching once you've started. I love them all. Te amo!!!"	1
9	Good one : must watch	If you are web series lover go for it. It's not killer one as all one says like, Over hyped series. Sometimes it doesnt seems like logic.	1
9	great TV	It will keep u up till morning u don't know whats coming that's what i love about this TV show	1
9	I LOVE this show	A lot of people have mixed opinions about seasons three and four but I actually really liked them, although think that they definitely were not as good as the first two. I just wish It played out more smoothly like the first two seasons. They were a little too intense for me and I liked the first two much better but overall this is a amazing show and it has a really good story.	1
10	Had me hooked instantly	Honestly the best thing I've seen in a long time! You love all the characters within the first couple of episodes, you're always on your seat, the suspense is real and no character is expendable ... As for all the actors I sincerely think they are better than Hollywood!	1
10	It's amazing, don't listen to anyone who says it isn't	You can't keep your eyes off it, Seasons 1 and 2 are amazing, season 3 i agree the plot is kind of dumb, still good after a couple of episodes.. and seaosn 4 goes back to being amazing! One of my favorite shows of all time.. MAYBE it's a culture thing, some people from countries without passion might find it bad, but it isn't.	1
10	Enjoyable	Its really enjoyable, don't go at what people are screaming regarding 3rd and 4th season, i enjoyed 3rd and 4th season as well. It has pretty decent plot and certainly filled with what one wanted after the end of season 2.	1
8	Seasons 1 and 2, brilliant. Season 3 and 4, not so much...	"Seasons 1 and 2 were wonderfully executed, and made for a great watch. I'd give a 9/10 for the first seasons, but the last two seasons were so poorly written with the dragging, boring flashbacks and cliché action scenes.

The second season would've ended the show perfectly. The new seasons are very disappointing, and there will most likely be a fifth season judging by the ending of season 4, but I'm not expecting anything other than a stretched out finale for the show."	1
10	Must See Amazing	Best tv series ever i cant wait for season 5 but i know its gona be a long wait, such cool characters, great script AMAZING YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED	1
10	Loved it	I rated season 1 and 2 10/10. It was so amazing. I actually finished 2 seasons in one day. I couldn't wait to rate until the end.	1
10	Vert engaging	Great series very edgy who dunnit type series i hope they get the money iam just on part 2 episode 5	1
10	Brilliant	This show is so riveting, you can't stop watching. Every detail is so well thought out. Can't wait for season 5.	1
9	Recommend series in 2020	Cheers for the scriptwriter 🍻 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
10	I can say happily,	This is top tv show of 2020 After prison break this is the 2nd best tv show	1
10	Wwoowww.... It is the best you can watch thi sunmer.	"One of the most thrilling, smart, and unpredictable series i have ever watched. Takes you through emotions, tricks, strategies and mind of people belonging to boths side of the stories

Higly recommended, hugely popular for a reason and a must to watch in your watchlist."	1
9	Money heist season 5 request	I really like the way this series is written but the last episodes of season 3 and 4 disappointed me at the end.i would like to know if we will get the 5th season	1
9	La Casa de Papel	In fact, it's a left-wing TV play with revolutionary themes. The whole robbery is a big metaphor. The people at the bottom fight against capitalism. The rhythm is great, the narration is proper, the foreshadowing is reasonable, the character is three-dimensional, the fighting wisdom fights bravely. It is a very wonderful story.	1
10	In ❤	"In love (all characters) except ARTURO Berlin>professor>Tokio>Raquil>Nairobi>Moscow>Helsinki!!

I loved all seasons but most people Doesn't like No one can deny that ""it's keeps you on the edge of your seat"" Until you don't end it. And it will take time to your mind to get over it, Thats challenge🤙

Vice Versa Superhit Mind-game"	1
10	Best show ever!	"I cant stop watching it. I love everything. The characters, the plot, the complicated relationships, the action, the sentimental moments. I cried, i laughed, i gasped in awe and i loved every single second of it. Denver is by far my favourite character he is flawed but so kind and his laugh... omg his laugh. I can't even.

<< slight spoiler>>

If anything happened to him i swear to god id just cry myself to sleep for the next couple of months. Plz dont kill my bae in the nexr season ^^"	1
10	Nairobi death / funeral	It was so painful that a character like Nairobi has to leave this wonderful series, but with her befitting burial given to her, am very overwhelmed. Amazingly fantastic	1
9	Perfect series for binge watching	The first tv series I ever binge watched. The show is fast packed and action packed. The characters are well defined and you connect with them instantly. The plot and execution of the story line is good. Very hard to miss this one.	1
10	Best show I have ever seen in my life	I was so hung up on the show that I stayed up till 4 AM on a school night to watch Season one and then the other seasons came out And not even a single episode has disappointed me it had me on the edge all the time. you never knew what was going to happen and it's very exciting and and good I give it a 10 out of 10	1
10	Amazing	One of the best series I've ever seen. I recommend everyone to see it. you won't regret.	1
10	Part/Episodes	I wish Netflix would do more the 8 episodes on a parts the show is great I just watched all episodes in a day in a half and that is because there is only 8 episodes a part	1
9	Superb Experience	"I found this Spanish TV series by chance, I really recommend you watch it. It's one of the best series that I have seen lately. A chess game between the police and the robbers, you will be surprised by its development.

Professor gave justice to his role. What a legend. You'll get addicted to the show and you'll start admiring some characters while hating the others. Seriously I got so much involved in the show that I started cursing some of the characters. Who thought a TV series on a money heist will be so interesting."	1
10	World's Best series 👌 of All time	This is not just a series it's an emotion It's contain surprises events Also that brilliant Mind of Professor	1

9	Season 4 upgraded my view on this from 7/10 to 9/10	"The first 2 seasons start quiet different but amazing in its own way. I kinda disliked some of the romance and characters, especially the tryhard strong independent woman role.

Season 4 was different, completely keeping me on my stupid treadmill for 130 minutes without break. so much tension i couldnt waste a minute doing smth else. At this season the serie shifted to a more aggressive and action style and i rly like that."	1
9	Not a review but Anticipation	The professor - Denver - Helsinki will die in season 5 as the scene of Nairobi in the red dress showed only Berlin-Moscow-Oslo who died in the first 2 seasons	1
10	Recommended to binge watch	Really addictive and full of excitement and actions	1
10	A masterpiece	This series is just so masterclass.Every episode is full of suspense.It makes you believe as what happening is real and if you were in the shoes of the police you were going to do just what they did.Big Ups to Alex Pina for such a wonderful piece.Cant wait for Season 5.	1
9	Good show	I've watched continuous for long and long and long hours. It is really a great series. All character is superb. I started thinking like professor in any work i do. I ll be having plan what if that goes wrong. OMG !!! professor is really a epic character. In series 4, denvor said i am going for surrender with white hanky outside then at the same time why police didn't enter.	1
10	La cuarta temporada... Brillante!	Excelente! Sin precedentes... Las actuaciones son formidables...	1
10	Great suspense	This triller keeps you glued to the TV Simply amazing	1
9	4th season save the 3rd...	Fortunately season 4 is better than 3 and the whole series is saved.	1
9	Superb marvellous	I started watching money heist s4 i guess around 9:00 pm and at 4:30 am I finished. I watched consecutively 8 episodes while m so sleepy but attraction of this season didn't allow me to sleep it compel me to keep awakening and watching. I highly recommend to watch	1
9	Rating for first 2 seasons	I really liked the first 2 seasons, because of unexpected events and unpredictable story lines but now it has become too easy to guess what is going to happen next. Many scenes were unnecessary.	1
10	Top class	Wonderful show.... All the characters are played well	1
10	One of the best	Must watchable web series. The oersons who love thrilling movies will must watch this web series...... it wont drop your hope	1
10	Slow start but then...	Slow start but then... excellent plot and you Will love the characters!	1
10	Tihis series is legendary!	"I really enjoy every moment of the La Casa de Papel!

Every episode is great on its own way. Many episodes also show the happy and sad moments in the series.

It also is really emotional and you can feel a lot. I cried many times while watching La Casa de Papel.

But the best thing is, that you can also really talk with the fans who also watch the series.

I talked with so many people about it. We even shared our own theories."	1
10	The best series I have watched for a long time!	I'm very tuff on choosing what to watch, I search for hours and hours, so I don't waste my time. But this ladies and gentleman, this is a masterpiece. I randomly checked it's resume and was like, why not let's give it a check, and the truth is I just ended the series and waiting for season 4. An amazing set of actors and plot twists. Brilliant directing, acting. The actors perfectly fit their roles, and you get all the hype just watching it.	1
10	Thrilling Season	Netflix recommended it to me and I'm recommending to you. If you want a never ending amazing ride then watch it. A suspenseful plot implacably unfolding, a lot of unexpected twists. Refreshing storyline unlike most other movies or series about bank robberies. Professor gave justice to his role. What a legend. You'll get addicted to the show and you'll start admiring some characters while hating the others. It's not just a movie or a script. It is a wonderful work as a philosophy. There is a great slap in the capitalist system.	1
9	Professor is the best	I was surprised to this series It also have emotional attachment	1
9	Flawless Art	One the nicest TV show. Everything is perfectly controlled ans imaginable. After Narcos this is the 2nd Spanish tv show watched by Indian people. I would rather say its a art to make a show like that. Really appreciate and thanks for making such a wonderful show.	1
10	Awesome	Awesome is the word enough to explain this show. An extravaganza of thrill, heist, twist, drama moulded in a package for a bigger message - this show deserves to be Netflix's most watched non-English show till date. The acting is top-notch. The characterisation of each character is fabulous. The screenplay is tight and edgy. It has awesome toe-curling moments. Overall, a must watch for all lovers.	1
10	Best series I've ever seen	This series is amazing, fit for any adult audience	1
10	#1	My number 1 Netflix show. Love it can't wait for part 4 and the supposedly 5th and 6th parts	1
10	Epic on another level	This show is just amazing you don't feel time passing watching this so addicting the music and everything is epic I loved it can't wait for part 4	1
10	Awseome series	This is one of best series so far. Season 1 and 2 are exceptionally good . Awesome plot , best of cast .you can't sleep till you finished it. But season 3 was more on emotional side .. In game of heist this looks unreal . Looks like bollywood typical serials.	1
10	SO GOOD	Oh my god This series is the best thing on streaming at the moment I watched three seasons in 3 days Could not stop Bring on Season 4	1
10	The best series I've watched	All is incredible here, the story is unique, the production and the quality of the actors that are so incredibly talent. The atmosphere of each episode makes you want to continue watching non stop.	1
10	Masterpiece....my life feels Complete and satisfied after seeing this....	If this isn't the best tv show that what would be it... I have seen all the great shows GOT BAD stranger things and much more .. I would say ...Money heist is THE MASTERPIECE....it's the only MASTERPIECE 10/10 in all edges... The director deserves an Oscar...for sure...	1
10	Best of the best	I watched breaking bad a few years ago and i could not find any other series like BB. Once i saw the ad of la casa de pepal and through in my watch list. And when i saw its 1st episode I watched the whole 3 seasons in 2 days. It is just incredible	1

10	Berlin and Tokyo are the top best & of course we don't forget the professor	Best series ever deserves top rated show, plus need 10/10 review in the top	1
8	PRISON BREAK IN A BANK	I cant lie that this was an entertaining show, great actors, great charred building. But i have seen this before in prison break SPOILERS just like prison break first season then it swirls into other things. But in simple great entertaining show, addictive to watch.	1
10	Best series ever! Even better than GOT.	Amazing masterpiece, with amazing overturns and excellent casting. Cannot wait for the 4th season. Hope that they will produce more seasons. If you start watching you cannot stop until you have finished thw whole seasons.	1
10	Absolutely Superb	Waiting for season 4....finished 3 season in 3 weeks.	1
10	Find something fabulous	But if not a fourth part of this wonderful work would be better	1
8	Not Perfect But Worth Watching	It is a very interesting, exciting, well acted series. Because of its length there are holes in the story here & there that doesn't seem realistic But, it's a caper movie that kept me entertained for days. The characters are played perfectly & the planning very well done. My opinion is don't miss it.	1
9	Should have at Season 2	"It should have ended at Season 2. There was no need to make season 3. But I guess the success of first two seasons lured the makers to start Season 3 which was mostly boring except for the last episode.

The first two seasons were simply brilliant and outstanding. I wish this was originally made in English coz watching its dubbed version is no fun either."	1
10	First Review Ever	This is not the kind of show I would normally watch but my mom and sister recommended it and I saw a piece of part 3 which looked interesting. Let's just say I was not ready for it to be soooo good that I had to binge all three seasons in one week. I'm honestly about to rewatch it. It was THAT good. This is easily the best TV show ever created.	1
10	Masterpiece	Perfectly weitten and well executed. AmaZing. Thrilling. Superb	1
10	The Best	One of the best series. Watched it twice, can't wait for season 4. Professor & Inspector will keep you glued to the show. Itzair Ituño is just awesome.	1
9	Very entertaining and gripping	Very nicely scripted twists and turns makes this simple money heist something more than what it looks on surface. Best binge watching in a while. Best character- professor!	1
10	This is my first complete season.	You ll not believe, i could not go long with game of throne trying that to be my first season. But this is something extraordinary. Loved this with heart.	1
10	Super recommended	Just amazing show, it has a all in classic movie, sex, hate , love and revenge!!!!	1
10	Wow its heartfelt	I have watched various TV series on crime but this one ,which make you anxious about next move what it would be .the characters are very perfect .I love one which is called professor.he played beyond critic .storyline is as good as perfermoance.i have watched all the episodes continuously till I found it ended .so here I am waiting for next season .	1
10	Must to be on your watchlist	I'm so much addicted to this series. Love all the twists and turns. The direction of storytelling is so damn strong which makes me fall in love with all the characters.	1
10	Great show	I love everything about this show. It's serious, but is funny when it has to be, and the characters are great as wel.	1
10	Obsessed!!!	I freaking love this show all the actors did such a incredibly good job!! I truly enjoyed Tokyo..... IG Chrisdeown	1
9	Truely magnificent!!...	This is definitely a must watch series.This series has got a great potential.It is well planned and the intelligence of the Mastermind is definitely admirable..	1
10	Just Watch it!!!	Powerful series. Watch it now. Awesome Story.I started this series thinking that it would be like other robbery Shows but it was totally different. It have every genre in it Written perfectly. Keeps you at the edge of your seat with it's brilliantly written storyline	1
10	Spell perfection = Money Heist	"By the time you will be watching last few minutes of 13th episode of season 1 you will be singing ""Bella Ciao"" along with Professor & Berlin.

Money heist is exceptional, top notch performance through out in every department."	1
9	Intriguing but not every episode is a nailbiter	A big mistake that leads the series is that in s01e12 raquels mother listens to angels message in which hi clearly states salva's name but rather in next episode when salva introduces himself to her mother at the door she invites him in like no clues whatsoever 👀	1
9	Finished within 2 days	My headline says what and how this show is. With fast moving story, lot of twists and turns make you not to turn of the device. Hats off to the writer and it is executed so well. The only show that I liked after The Breaking Bad. For God sake they should release 4th season early, I'm eagerly waiting.	1
10	Zany and intelligent	Absolutely fantastic series. This is up amongst with the best series I've ever seen. Really good casting and I fell in love with all the characters. A great combination of thrilling, funny and totally engaging with a clever storyline that doesn't insult your intelligence.	1
8	REVIEW OF PART 3	"In Netflix's part 1 and part 2, there were so many new and great stuff with amazingly creative ideas. In part 3, there are almost no such thing that we can sort as ""new and creative"". Yes, I liked this part too but first ones were better. Also, Im excited for part 4 because everything about series may proof that part 4 is coming. Great characters, great story, great atmosphere... It is worth to see it."	1
9	Really good	I loved the series from the first episode, but i belive the third season should had a more dramatic ending, it looked like just the beginning of the next season	1
9	Exciting heist and trama!	This tv serie has an exciting trama and is full of twist. I enjoyed watch this tv serie!	1
8	Insiders men?	Just Saw inside man. (2006) compare. Ache. Akward. Copycat? Sew them?	1
